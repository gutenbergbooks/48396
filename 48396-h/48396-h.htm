<h1>PATTY'S PERVERSITIES.</h1>

<p class="ph2"><a name="ChI." id="ChI.">CHAPTER I.</a></p>

<h3>MORNING.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> is one thing sure," mused Patty Sanford,
newly awakened by the sun's rays which
streamed through her honeysuckle-draped casement;
"there is one thing sure,&mdash;I shall go to the picnic with
whom I like: else why should I go at all? To-day
they will come to invite me. Burleigh will come, of
course; but it is easy to get rid of him. Then Clarence
Toxteth is sure to ask me. How it piques the
girls to see me behind his span! Clarence's span is
so nice! It is a pity he isn't&mdash;I mean I wish I
liked him better. But he isn't always saying horrid
things, like Tom Putnam. I wonder if Tom will ask
me. I do so hope he will, so I can snub him. I'm
sure," she continued to herself, in her energy raising
herself upon her dimpled elbow,&mdash;"I'm sure I don't
know anybody who needs snubbing more than he. If
he only would come after Clarence has invited me,
that would be fun. He'd manage to come out superior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
though, in some way. He always does; and
that's the worst of him&mdash;or the best, I'm not quite
certain which. There! Will would say I was 'moonier
than the moon.'&mdash;Flossy, Floss!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered a sleepy voice from the next
chamber.</p>

<p>"Are you awake?"</p>

<p>"Well," the voice replied with great deliberation,
"not as much as some."</p>

<p>"You'd better be, then. There are oceans of things
to see to to-day."</p>

<p>At that moment was heard from below the voice of
Mrs. Sanford, calling her daughter; and Patty hastily
began her toilet for the early breakfast, already being prepared
below by Bathalina Clemens, the maid of all work.</p>

<p>The company assembled around the breakfast-table
consisted, in addition to Patty, of her father and
mother, her brother Will, and a cousin rejoicing in
the euphonious title of Flossy Plant.</p>

<p>Dr. Sanford was a tall, thin-faced gentleman, with
deep, kindly eyes, and slightly-stooping shoulders.
He would have been hen-pecked, but for the fact that
he was so fully aware of his wife's peculiarities as to be
able to guard himself against them. He smiled at her
vagaries and gallinaceous ways with a quiet, inward
sense of humor.</p>

<p>"Your aunt is a very amusing woman," he once
said to Flossy Plant; and, indeed, it was sometimes
difficult for the whole family not to regard Mrs. Sanford
as a species of private Punch and Judy intended
for their especial entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>This morning the worthy lady was discussing the
church picnic, to take place the following day.</p>

<p>"I think," she said impressively, "that picnics are
chiefly bugs and critters; but I suppose it is a duty
folks owe to religion to go."</p>

<p>"And to ride there with the gentlemen," put in
Flossy, seeing the twinkle in her uncle's eye.</p>

<p>"But the buggies are so terrible narrow nowadays,"
Mrs. Sanford continued, the breadth of her figure giving
point to the remark, "that one is squeezed to
death. The last time I rode in one I dreamed, the
next night, that I was a postage-stamp on a letter;
and, of course, that couldn't be a lucky dream."</p>

<p>"Oh, the narrow buggies are the beauty of it!"
Flossy retorted: "it brings you and the gentlemen so
close and cosey, you know."</p>

<p>"Flossy Plant!" exclaimed Bathalina Clemens, who
was bringing in a fresh supply of griddle-cakes, and
felt called upon, as she frequently did, to "bear testimony."
"Flossy Plant, that is positively indelicate."</p>

<p>"Bathalina Clemens," returned Flossy serenely,
"you don't know the very first principles of indelicacy."</p>

<p>In the general laugh that greeted this sally Mrs.
Sanford did not join.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," she said; "but I'm
sure it isn't proper. Besides," she continued, "I have
a foreboding in my mind. I put my left shoe on my
right foot this morning, and I doubt something will
happen: besides, I know strangers are coming, for my
nose itches; and Bathalina dropped the dish-cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
last night; and a fork stuck up straight in the floor this
morning."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," Patty said lightly. "The more
people that come to-day, the better Floss and I shall
be pleased, if they come to invite us to the picnic."</p>

<p>"Flossy," interrupted Mrs. Sanford, "you have
spilled your salt. Throw a pinch over your left shoulder
quick. It is strange how careless folks can be;
just the day before a picnic too.&mdash;And then," she
rambled on, "there's the cooking. Patty, you'll have
to make the cake, and do all the millinery of the
cooking: you ought to have picked over the raisins
before breakfast."</p>

<p>"If I do any thing before breakfast," Flossy said,
"I have to have my breakfast first."</p>

<p>"So do I," Patty laughed; "but I can make up for
lost time afterward."</p>

<h2><a name="ChII." id="ChII.">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>"A BIRD IN THE BUSH."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was while Patty was engaged in doing "the millinery
of the cooking," that her first swain arrived.
Social etiquette in Montfield was not rigid, and Patty
was not at all surprised when the shadow of Burleigh
Blood's broad shoulders fell upon the kitchen-floor,
and that enamoured youth entered without the formality
of knocking.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Burleigh," she said, her eyes bright
with the spark of merriment which always kindled
when Mr. Blood appeared. "Can't shake hands with
you without getting you all covered with flour."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind that much," he answered awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Sit down, please," she said. "I'm just done with
these puffs. Isn't it a lovely day?"</p>

<p>"It is good growing weather for the corn."</p>

<p>"And for you," she laughed. "You get bigger and
bigger every day."</p>

<p>"Do I?" he said disconsolately, looking from his
big hand to the one she was wiping on the long snowy
roller. "I am too big now."</p>

<p>"Nonsense&mdash;not for a man! I like to see a man
big and strong."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you, though, really," he said, a glow of delight
spreading over his honest features. "I&mdash;I'm glad of
it."</p>

<p>"Come into the other room," Patty said, leading
the way: "it's cooler there.&mdash;Bathalina, don't let
those puffs burn."</p>

<p>The windows of the sitting-room were open, and
the blinds unclosed; but so thickly was the piazza
overhung with honeysuckle and woodbine, that a cool
shade filled the apartment. It was unoccupied, save
by Pettitoes, the cat, who had curled himself up luxuriously
in Mrs. Sanford's work-basket. Mr. Blood
stumbled over a chair or two before he found his way
safely into a seat, and then sat, flushed and uncomfortable,
trying to make up his mind to do the errand upon
which he had come. Patty, who knew perfectly well
the state of her guest's mind, played carelessly with
Pettitoes, making casual remarks, to which Burleigh
replied in monosyllables.</p>

<p>"I hope it will be as good weather as this for the
picnic," she said at length. "Of course, you are
going?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I should; that is, I may."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must! We are sure to have a splendid
time. Everybody is going. I wouldn't miss it for
any thing."</p>

<p>"Then you are going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course. I am always ready for a lark," she
answered. "And I know you'll go."</p>

<p>"It depends," said he, "whether I can get any one
to go with me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course you can. There are lots of girls would
be delighted. There's Emily Purdy, or Dessie Farnum.
You know you can get some one."</p>

<p>"But I mean one particular one," he said, blushing
at his own temerity.</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean Flossy," Patty exclaimed, her
eyes dancing. "I'm sure she'll be delighted. I'll ask
her myself for you this minute. You are so bashful,
Burleigh, that you'd never get along in this world, if I
didn't help you."</p>

<p>"Wait, Patty," the unfortunate Burleigh began; but
his voice stuck in his throat. For days he had been
summoning his courage to invite Miss Sanford to ride
with him to the picnic; and now it failed him in his
extremity. To add to his confusion, his eye at that
moment caught sight of a rival advancing from the
front-gate towards the cottage in the person of Clarence
Toxteth, only child of the richest man in Montfield.
A sudden burning sensation seized young
Blood at the sight. He was ready to pour out his
heart and his passion in the moment that remained to
him. But what is love in the heart, albeit never so
burning, when the tongue refuses its office? A flippant
rogue without a soul may defeat the most deeply
loyal silent one, and never a word could Burleigh utter.
He was conscious, as if in a dream, that the bell rang,
and that Mr. Toxteth, in all the glory of a light summer
suit and kid gloves, was ushered into the room.
He unconsciously glowered at the new-comer in a
way that made it difficult for Patty to preserve her
gravity. The entrance of Mrs. Sanford restored him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to himself somewhat. He always felt more comfortable
for her bustling, homely presence.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Burleigh?" the worthy lady said.
"How do you do, Mr. Toxteth? I knew we should
see strangers to-day. You remember, Patty, I said so
at breakfast. Bathalina dropped the dish-cloth, and
then a fork that stood up in the floor, and I never
knew either of those signs to fail. You must be the
dish-cloth, Burleigh, and you are the fork, Mr. Toxteth.
I always think the dish-cloth don't mean as
much of a stranger as the fork does."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford had a never-ending procession of
signs and omens. "The wisest aunt" could scarcely
have extracted more mystical lore from everyday
occurrences to other observers the most commonplace.
Every thing with her was lucky or unlucky,
related to the past, or foretold the future; and the
wisdom she extracted from dreams was little less than
miraculous.</p>

<p>What Dr. Sanford was accustomed to term "the
religious ceremonies of a call,"&mdash;the remarks upon
health and the weather,&mdash;having been duly accomplished,
Mr. Toxteth proceeded directly to the
point.</p>

<p>"I called," he said, while Mrs. Sanford was asking
his rival about the prospects of the crops, "to
beg the honor of your company to-morrow at the
picnic."</p>

<p>"How kind of you!" Patty answered with an appearance
of sweet frankness; the inward struggle
which had been going on ever since his entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
being suddenly decided against him. "I am very
sorry, if you will be disappointed; but, you see, Burleigh
came before you."</p>

<p>She spoke so softly that her mother did not hear;
yet the words reached the ears of her earlier caller,
and filled him with triumphant joy. For Patty herself,
she was not quite able to understand her own act.
She had beforehand fully determined to accept the
invitation to ride behind the Toxteth span, should she
be favored with it; and she certainly had even now
no intention of going with Burleigh Blood. It was
partly due, no doubt, to the fact that the dandified air
of the young fop offended her honest taste; but she
was uncomfortably conscious that there was a stronger
reason underlying all others. She had said to herself
that it would be charming to reject an invitation from
Mr. Putnam after having promised to accompany
Clarence Toxteth. Now she had refused the latter
upon the mere chance that the former would come.
She would gladly have recalled the words, and given
a different answer to the rich young swell, with his
elegant clothes, and a turnout which was the admiration
of all the girls in Montfield. But there was now no
help for it; and with a sigh she saw the form of
her rich suitor disappear down the walk, and turned
to the task in hand. She knew Burleigh had overheard
her refusal to Clarence; and, as soon as the
latter was gone, she said lightly, "I knew you wouldn't
mind my making you an excuse to put him off; and,
besides, mother was here, and wouldn't have liked it
if I had refused him outright. Here comes Flossy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
It is very kind of you to ask her; for she really knows
so few people here."</p>

<p>Flossy Plant was a little maiden much afflicted by
dyspepsia, and given to making odd remarks. Her
father was a Boston merchant, noted for his dinners;
and Flossy always maintained that his high living
caused her ill-health.</p>

<p>"I am like that text of Scripture," she declared:
"'The fathers have eaten sour grapes,&mdash;or drank their
juice,&mdash;and the child's stomach is set on edge.' I don't
mind the dyspepsia so much, but oh! think of the
good things father has eaten to give it to me."</p>

<p>Her physician had ordered the constant use of pop-corn;
and Flossy was accustomed to wander about the
house at all times of day and night with a large blue
bowl of that dry and aggravating edible tucked comfortably
under her arm. Her hair, fine and flaxen,
was generally in a state aptly enough described by her
name; so that it was not without reason that Will
Sanford compared her to a thistle-puff.</p>

<p>"I thought I would wait," Flossy said, as she came
into the sitting-room, "until Clarence Toxteth went
away. He always looks so soft and juicy that I want
to eat him, and it makes me dreadfully hungry to look
at him."</p>

<p>Burleigh laughed; but this little pale creature was a
mystery to him, and her dryly-uttered drolleries not
wholly devoid of a sibylline character, it being a profound
wonder to him how one could have such thoughts.</p>

<p>"I don't think he'd be good to eat," he said grimly;
"but I guess he'd be soft enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he come to invite you to the picnic, Patty?"
Flossy asked, munching at her pop-corn.</p>

<p>"What would you give to know?" laughed her
cousin. "But Mr. Blood has come to invite you, at
least: so you are provided for."</p>

<p>In such a situation what was a bashful man to do,
particularly if, like Burleigh, he was not sure that he
was offended at the turn affairs had taken? Patty
was an old friend, indeed, in Montfield parlance a
"flame" of the young man's; yet certainly the stranger
cousin exercised over him a peculiar fascination.
He left the house as the promised escort of Miss
Plant, and went home, wondering whether Patty did
not know he came to invite her, and whether he were
glad or sorry things had turned out as they had.</p>

<p>The long sunny day wore on, and no third invitation
came for Patty. She kept her own counsel so
completely that the family thought she had accepted
young Toxteth's escort,&mdash;an impression which she
took pains not to dissipate. But, although outwardly
gay, she grew more and more heavy-hearted as the
day passed with no sign of Mr. Putnam.</p>

<h3>"A BIRD IN THE HAND."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of the picnic dawned as fair and sweet
as if made for a pure girl's wedding, or a children's
holiday.</p>

<p>The gathering was to take place at Mackerel Cove,
a little bay jutting inward, amid lovely groves of
beech-trees, from a larger inlet of the Atlantic. A
drive of a dozen miles stretched between the cove
and Montfield; the picnickers taking their own time
for starting, and speed in going, the rendezvous being
at the hour fixed for dinner.</p>

<p>Patty saw the family depart one by one. First
Will went to call for Ease Apthorpe, the lady-elect of
his heart or fancy; then Dr. Sanford drove off with
his wife, intending to visit certain patients on the
way; and, last of all, Flossy was swung lightly up into
his buggy by the mighty arms of Burleigh Blood.</p>

<p>"Don't you mean to go at all?" the latter asked of
Patty, who came running after them with Flossy's bowl
of pop-corn.</p>

<p>"I never tell my plans," she laughed gayly. "Mother
went off predicting that something dreadful was
sure to happen. How do you know but I am afraid to
go?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pooh! She's going with Clarence Toxteth," Flossy
said.</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;began her escort.</p>

<p>"There! Drive on, and don't bother about me,"
said Patty. "I have usually been thought able to
take care of my own affairs. A pleasant ride to you."</p>

<p>She turned back toward the lonely house. Bathalina
Clemens was at work somewhere in the chambers,
counteracting any tendency to too great cheerfulness
which the beauty of the day might develop in her
mind, by singing the most doleful of minors:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Hearken, ye sprightly, and attend, ye vain ones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pause in your mirth, adversity consider;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn from a friend's pen sentimental, painful<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Death-bed reflections,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she sang, with fearful inflections and quavers. Patty's
face fell. A feeling of angry disappointment came
over her. This picnic was an event in Montfield.
What to the belle of the season would be the loss of
its most brilliant ball was this privation to Patty. This
is a relative world, wherein the magnitude of an object
depends upon the position of the eye which observes
it; and for the time being the picnic filled the whole
field of mental vision of the young people of the village.
Nor did it tend to lessen the girl's annoyance
that the fault was her own, although she resolutely
persisted in thinking that she thought herself not at
all responsible, but had transferred the entire blame
upon the shoulders of the cavalier who should have
invited her, and had not. She wandered restlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
through the house and garden, at last seating herself
upon the piazza with a book, upon which she vainly
attempted to fix her attention. From above came the
voice of Bathalina chanting,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Shun my example!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'Shun your example!'" muttered Patty to herself.
"I shall shun my own hereafter. I might have known
that poky old Tom Putnam wouldn't ask me. It is
too mean that I should have to stay at home! He
might at least have given me a chance to refuse him,
and then I should have known what to count on. He
is so intensely aggravating. I don't doubt he took
Flora Sturtevant. I've no patience with a man that
will let himself be trapped by a flirt like her."</p>

<p>And at that moment, raising her eyes, she saw the
object of her animadversions&mdash;a tall, slender man of
two or three and thirty&mdash;coming up the walk. He
seemed surprised to find her at home.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," Mr. Putnam said, in a voice
which few persons heard with indifference, so rich and
pleasing it was. "I supposed you had gone to the
picnic."</p>

<p>"You see I haven't."</p>

<p>It required no great penetration to see that Patty
was out of spirits. The new-comer looked at her
keenly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will sit down for a moment," he
said, as if she had invited him to do so. "These steps
are very comfortable. Don't trouble to get me a
chair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had not the faintest intention of doing so," she
returned.</p>

<p>"Why have you not gone?" he asked, looking up
at her curiously from his seat upon the piazza-steps.</p>

<p>"I chose to stay at home," she answered shortly.</p>

<p>"Conclusive, but impossible. A better reason,
please?"</p>

<p>"I do not know that it can make any difference to
you why I stay at home."</p>

<p>"But it does, however ignorant you may be on that
point."</p>

<p>"Why should it?"</p>

<p>"You have not answered me," he said; "but I will
be generous, and tell you why. I was coming yesterday
to invite you myself, and heard that you were
going with Burleigh Blood."</p>

<p>"Did you?" she asked, brightening visibly. "That
was a lie I told, or rather a lie I didn't tell. How
did you hear of it?"</p>

<p>"I heard Clarence Toxteth say so. Is your list of
questions much longer?"</p>

<p>"If Bathalina doesn't stop singing such hymns,"
Patty said irrelevantly, "I know I shall murder her
sooner or later."</p>

<p>"I would," he answered, looking at his watch. "I
came for a book of your father's; but it is no matter
to-day. I will have the horse at the gate in fifteen
minutes. Can you be ready so soon?"</p>

<p>"Who said I'd go?" she laughed, springing up.</p>

<p>"Who asked you to?" he retorted.</p>

<p>"But I will, if only to plague you," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't feel obliged to," he replied, starting down
the walk. "It really won't annoy me enough to make
it worth your trouble."</p>

<p>Patty darted into the house, and up to her chamber,
like a swallow. Unconsciously she caught up Bathalina's
strain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Sudden and awful, from the height of pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By pain and sickness thrown upon a down-bed,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she carolled; and for once the hymn put on a garb of
mocking gayety.</p>

<p>"Patience Sanford!" solemnly ejaculated the pious
maid-servant, putting her head in at the chamber-door.
"It's tempting Providence to sing that hymn that way.
No good'll come of it, you may depend."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Bath! I could dance to the hymns of
the cherubim!"</p>

<p>And into the garden she flew to pin a bunch of
clove-pinks at her belt.</p>

<p>"Do you know how solemn you looked," Putnam
asked as they drove along the smooth road, between
unfenced fields green with the starting aftermath,
"when I found you on the piazza? Were you thinking
of your sins?"</p>

<p>"No: of those of my neighbors."</p>

<p>"Of omission, or commission?" he asked, looking
at her closely.</p>

<p>"Both," she returned, flushing a little. "I was
lonesome, of course. You wouldn't like to stay at
home alone all day."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he said, "there are few things I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
like better. It is strange how a woman is never good
company for herself. She can never keep still and
think, but must always be rattling away to somebody."</p>

<p>"You think so because you don't know."</p>

<p>"My observation has not been very extensive, perhaps;
but it has been all in one direction. Men are
content enough to be alone."</p>

<p>"It is all the conceit of the men," she retorted.
"You all fancy you are never in so good company as
when alone."</p>

<p>"Unless we are favored by some one of your sex."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You don't think so. What a man
finds to say to himself, I cannot imagine; unless,
indeed, his mind is one grand vacuum."</p>

<p>"The wisdom of a man's reflections must always be
beyond a woman's comprehension," he returned.
"Some men have made great mistakes by forgetting
this."</p>

<p>"Then, of course, you'll never marry," Patty ventured.
"You wouldn't want a companion who couldn't
understand you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I may join 'the noble army of martyrs,'" he
answered in the same bantering tone he had been
using. "Every man will be ruled by some women;
and with a wife his resistance would be a trifle less
restrained, you see."</p>

<p>"I have heard it said," she answered, "that, as love
increased, good manners decreased; but I never made
such an application of it."</p>

<p>"Of course," he began, "having a legal mind, I
regard a wife as a piece of personal property, and"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"There!" she interrupted. "It is perfectly maddening
to hear you talk in that way about women. I
hate it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't mean any disrespect," he answered
soberly. "I should have married long ago,
had I been able."</p>

<p>"Whom would you have married?" she demanded.
"You speak as if you had only to make your selection,
and any girl would be glad of the chance to take you."</p>

<p>"That is because I think so highly of the penetration
of your sex," he retorted, with a return to his
light manner; adding, with some bitterness, "but,
when a man is as poor as a church mouse, he can
have as little thought of marrying, and being given in
marriage, as the angels in heaven."</p>

<p>"Don't be profane.  You have your profession."</p>

<p>"Oh! I earn enough to keep soul and body together,
if I don't do too much for either.  But this is
not a cheerful subject, even if it were in good taste for
me to be complaining of poverty.  Did you know my
nephews came last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I am so glad! It is always pleasant to
have Hazard Breck here.  Of course, they'll be at the
picnic."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Frank, you know, has graduated, and Hazard
is a junior.  It is two years since I have seen them."</p>

<p>"They probably feel ten years older. We are to
have company too. Grandmother is coming."</p>

<p>With such discourse they rolled over the country
road towards Mackerel Cove. Under the gay surface
of the conversation was a sting for Patty in the lawyer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
allusion to his poverty. He was usually very reticent
about his affairs; and it may have been for that reason
that the gossips of Montfield called him "close."
"He's close-mouthed and he's close-fisted," Mrs.
Brown was accustomed to say; "and most generally
the things go together."</p>

<p>To Patty's thinking few faults could be worse. To
an open-handed Sanford, avarice was the most disgusting
of vices; and this fatal defect in her companion
was like the feet of clay of the image of gold.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIV." id="ChIV.">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE PICNIC.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Seated</span> upon a stone which happened to be clean
enough for even her exacting taste, Mrs. Sanford
was conversing with Mrs. Brown, a frowsy lady whose
house-keeping was a perennial source of offence to
her order-loving neighbor. Mrs. Brown was a miracle
of tardiness,&mdash;the last-comer at every gathering, the
last guest to depart. Indeed, so fixed were her friends
in the habit of expecting her to be behindhand, that
she could have chosen no surer method of throwing
into confusion any plan wherein she was concerned
than by appearing for once on time; which, to do her
justice, she never did. "She is so slow," Will Sanford
once said, "that she always looks solemn at a
wedding, because the grief of the last funeral has just
got into her face. Her smiles appear by the time
another funeral comes."</p>

<p>On the present occasion Mrs. Brown had reached
Mackerel Cove just as preparations for dinner were
being completed. Mrs. Sanford, who had been superintending
the making of the coffee, had seated her
plump person upon the stone mentioned to rest and
get cool, when the late-comer appeared. Mrs. Brown
sank languidly upon the fallen trunk of a tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't know as I should ever get here," she said.
"My girl's gone mad."</p>

<p>"Gone mad!" ejaculated the doctor's wife. "I
knew something dreadful would happen when you
found that silver dollar, and kept it: that's always
unlucky. Is she really mad? You don't mean Selina?"</p>

<p>"No, not Selina, but the hired girl. She must be
mad. She poked all my hair-pins down a crack in
the floor. Selina thinks she did it to plague me; but
I know she's crazy."</p>

<p>"I declare! The trouble you have with your girls
beats every thing I ever heard of. I should think
you'd rather do the work yourself than have them
about."</p>

<p>"Oh! I must have a girl to shirk things on to," said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>"Shirk!" exclaimed Mrs. Sanford. "Lawful sakes!
I don't have time to shirk. If I hadn't so much to
do, I might find time to plan and contrive to get rid
of half my work; but now"&mdash;</p>

<p>The words died upon her lips as she caught sight
of a buggy coming along the shady wood-road. In it
sat her daughter Patty, chatting happily with Tom
Putnam. The sight filled her with amazement little
mixed with pleasure. The lawyer might be a man
after her husband's heart; but he was not after hers.
He constantly said things she could not understand;
he oppressed her as might an unguessed conundrum;
and, moreover, he was a dozen years older than her
daughter. Clarence Toxteth filled the measure of
Mrs. Sanford's requirements when she considered her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
daughter's matrimonial prospects, which, thrifty housewife
that she was, was not seldom. The young man
was rich, good-looking, trimly dressed; and Mrs.
Sanford appreciated to the full the advantages of the
possession of money. The worthy lady was not without
a deeply-seated suspicion that Patty, in the depth
of her heart, preferred the lawyer to his more pretentious
rival. The girl was like her father, and looked
at things in a way wholly unaccountable to her mother,
who saw only the other side of the shield. To-day
Mrs. Sanford had been at ease in her mind, believing
Toxteth to have been the chosen escort. She chanced
to be out of the way when he arrived at the picnic-ground,
and supposed her daughter to be about somewhere.
What, then, was her dismay to perceive her
driving up with Mr. Putnam, as boldly and gayly as
if she had never deceived her family!</p>

<p>"Is dinner ready, mother?" called the transgressor
lightly, as they drove up. "I am as hungry as three
polar bears."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Sanford!" the lawyer said.
"There is a delightful smell in the air, as if you had
been making coffee."</p>

<p>"So I have," she returned, a little mollified by the
compliment implied. "You are just in time: they
are blowing the horn now."</p>

<p>And indeed, through the beautiful beech-woods
rang the shrill cry of a tin dinner-horn blown by
lusty lungs. It sounded harsh enough in the sylvan
spaces; but not Pan himself could have piped more
enchantingly into the ears of the hungry country people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
scattered about in the grove. The young folk
came flocking towards the spot where table-cloths,
spread upon the mossy ground, were heaped with that
profusion of cake and other sweetmeats, and scarcity
of any thing eatable, by which a picnic-dinner is
usually characterized. A pleasant chattering and bustle
followed, while the company seated themselves around
upon stones, stumps, moss-covered roots, or the green
turf itself. Harmless practical jokes were played,
clumsy attempts at wit laughed over, clever ruses
employed by people who wished their being together
to have the appearance of the merest accident; and
amid the chatter, the laughter, and the rattle of
crockery, the feast began.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford had pressed Mr. Putnam into her
service to pour the coffee, knowing of old that he
was steady-handed and quick-witted, and feeling not
unwilling, moreover, to draw him away from Patty's
side. That young lady, being thus left to her own
devices, curled herself up in a soft mossy nook, between
two huge beech-roots, the tree-trunk behind her.</p>

<p>"I have a crow to pluck with you," the voice of
Clarence Toxteth said at her elbow.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's not pluck a crow!" she answered, without
turning her head. "It isn't pleasant; and nobody
feels any better for it."</p>

<p>"But why did you tell me you were coming with
Mr. Blood?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, laughing, and turning
to flash her dark eyes upon him. "I only said he
came before you to ask me, and so he did. You gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
up too easily. I knew by that, that you didn't really
care whether I came with you or not."</p>

<p>"Care? I did care. I thought you had promised
him: so I brought Miss Purdy, and you know I can't
endure her."</p>

<p>"I am sure she ought to be obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Well, there was nobody else."</p>

<p>"Was that the reason you came for me?" Patty
said saucily. "Flossy, what are you wandering about
so for?"</p>

<p>"I am seeking what I may devour," Flossy answered,
seating herself at her cousin's feet. "But I
do not find it. I'd like a square chunk out of the
side of a cow or a chicken. The sight of these deserts
of cake makes me sick."</p>

<p>"Make up your mind what you really would like,"
Clarence said, "and I'll order it of the wood-nymphs.
What will you have first,&mdash;turtle-soup?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!" Flossy answered. "I like to know
what I am eating, and turtle-soup is all green fat and
things. I'll eat a little pop-corn, if you please. So
saying I gayly munch and munch like an educated
mooly cow. Patty, where did you pick up Mr. Putnam?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere. He came after me."</p>

<p>"You didn't put him off with an evasive answer,"
Toxteth said in her ear.</p>

<p>"He didn't ask me," she retorted. "He only told
me he was coming to take me."</p>

<p>"You girls like to be bullied," the young man muttered
crossly.</p>

<p>"Mercy sakes!" cried the shrill voice of Mrs.
Brown, behind the tree at whose roots they were
seated. "I thought I heard dishes rattling; but I
didn't think dinner'd begun."</p>

<p>"Not only begun, but finished," Patty cried, springing
up. "Let's go down to the beach, Flossy."</p>

<h2><a name="ChV." id="ChV.">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>A MISHAP.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mackerel Cove</span> was surrounded by high
banks, the path from the grove above being
very steep and difficult. A rude hand-rail had been
nailed to the trees to assist the visitor in descending;
but the feat was still any thing but an easy one.</p>

<p>As Flossy and her cousin, with young Toxteth following,
took the path through the grove to the top of
the embankment, they fell in with several of their
friends going in the same direction.</p>

<p>Clarence saw, to his intense annoyance, Mr. Putnam
take his place at Patty's side; while he himself was
forced to drop into step with Miss Purdy. The etiquette
of Montfield was rather primitive, and demanded
that a gentleman should bestow his attentions
exclusively upon the lady whose escort he was for the
time being. A picnic was a gathering of couples, not
a homogeneous mixture of friends; and the young
people trooped along in pairs, with a prim and decorous
consciousness of doing the proper thing.</p>

<p>Miss Flora Sturtevant, however, was above any such
rustic etiquette. Miss Sturtevant, like Flossy, was a
Boston girl; and although at home there stretched between
them that fathomless abyss which is supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
divide the South End from the sacred precincts of the
West End, they met on a common footing at Montfield;
and Miss Plant was too good-humored to show
the superiority which her residence might give her
reason to feel. Flora was a cousin of Mrs. Brown,
who had passed several summers in Montfield, pecuniary
reasons having forbidden those excursions to
more expensive resorts for which her heart yearned.
She was rather stylish, and her pursuit of Mr. Putnam
was scarcely disguised. She was several years his
senior; but nature, having fashioned her face so that
she had never looked young, now apportioned to her
some compensation by preserving her from looking
old. On the present occasion she hovered about the
lawyer, asking his help at every obstacle, and so managing,
that, when they came to the edge of the embankment,
Patty, who had been gathering the red
clusters of the bunch-berry and the silvery blossoms
of the "wild everlasting," was a few steps behind.
Mr. Putnam turned to the latter, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"O Mr. Putnam!" Flora cried, stepping into the
narrow descending path, "do hold me! Oh, I shall
fall! I shall fall!"</p>

<p>She clutched his arm, and dragged him forward so
violently, that it was with difficulty he retained his
foothold, supporting as he did the entire weight of
Miss Sturtevant. He caught at the rail with so sudden
a wrench, that it was started from its fastenings. He
was able, however, to get the young lady to the
bottom unhurt, although they rushed down the path in
a way scarcely dignified, nearly overturning Burleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Blood and Flossy, who had just descended. Patty
was less fortunate. She had stepped forward, and
extended her hand to take that of her escort, only to
see that gentleman seized, and whirled down the precipitous
way like an unfortunate sinner in the clutch
of fiends, as portrayed in the frescos of the old masters.
Thrown from her balance, she sought the hand-rail;
but, already loosened, it gave way, and she
plunged headlong. Fortunately Putnam had time to
turn before she reached him, half falling, half running;
and he caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>"What a performance!" she exclaimed, laughing
and breathless. "I came down like a falling star. I
beg your pardon."</p>

<p>She extricated herself from the arms of the lawyer,
and planted her feet on the shingle, beginning to
smooth her dress. Suddenly she gave a smothered
scream, and for the first time in her life fainted dead
away, falling back again into the arms of her escort.
She had sprained her ankle badly, but in the excitement
had not noticed the mishap, until her weight was
thrown upon the injured limb.</p>

<p>"And then and there was hurrying to and fro."
Patty's cry was re-enforced by a shriek loud, shrill, and
long, from Miss Sturtevant, who, with no apparent
provocation, threw her arms about the lawyer's neck,
and went into violent hysterics.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Burleigh," Mr. Putnam cried
angrily, "take that girl off!&mdash;Spread out that shawl,
please, Miss Plant.&mdash;Bring some water, Will."</p>

<p>Miss Flora's hysterics were not so violent as to need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
any stronger restorative than the lawyer's words, and
she left him unhampered. Under the kindly offices
of her friends, Patty soon opened her eyes, and sat up
upon the shawls which had been hastily spread for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a goose I am!" she cried, as the situation
dawned upon her. "I never fainted in my life
before; but my ankle hurt terribly."</p>

<p>Dr. Sanford was soon on the spot, and proceeded to
put a compress upon the injured limb; the girls standing
about in a protecting circle. Mrs. Sanford stood
upon the bank above, unable to descend, but showering
down pathetic remarks.</p>

<p>"I knew something would happen," she said. "I
had a foreboding in my mind when I put my left foot
on my right shoe&mdash;no, I mean my right foot on my
left shoe. That isn't what I mean, either. But I told
Charles then I doubted something would happen to
this picnic.&mdash;Does it pain you much, Patty? I can't
get down without breaking my neck, and that wouldn't
do you any good.&mdash;Do you think she's lamed for
life, Charles?"</p>

<p>"Father," Patty said, forcing a smile, "I am really
very comfortable now, and don't need you: so you
can climb up, and quiet mother."</p>

<p>Patty now arranged herself picturesquely upon a
pile of shawls as on a divan, and held an impromptu
levee. Flora Sturtevant persisted in going down upon
her knees, and with a flood of tears begging forgiveness
for having caused the accident.</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose, Miss Sturtevant!" the other
laughed. "It was my own fault&mdash;or it isn't anybody's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
fault. There is salt water enough here now:
so don't shed any more tears."</p>

<p>Patty was a leader among the girls of Montfield;
and now they served her like a queen. They brought
her various rustic treasures,&mdash;red checkerberries, long
wreaths of ground-pine, the white, waxy Indian-pipes,
and mosses from the grove or from the water. Burleigh
Blood sat for half an hour breaking open live
mussels; and when at last a pearl rewarded his persistence,
he brought it to her as proudly as if it had
been already set in a betrothal ring. Dessie Farnum
and Emily Purdy came, dragging between them a
crooked tree-root, washed ashore by the waves, which
was pronounced just the thing for the back of a rustic
chair; and Clarence Toxteth undertook that the chair
should be manufactured accordingly.</p>

<p>The afternoon sped on happily and brightly. The
salt breeze always inspired Tom Putnam; and he was
the life of the party. Older than most of them, and
passing for a taciturn man, because he talked with few
people, the lawyer had yet a vivid fancy, a quick wit,
and a dry humor, which made him a charming companion
to those who shared his friendship. The day,
the lovely scene, the sea-air, the presence of the girl
he worshipped, and her escape from a fall which might
have been so much more serious, all tended to render
him joyous; and his gladness overflowed to all
the company.</p>

<p>Not all the picnickers, however, remained with
Patty. Frank Breck wanted to talk with Ease Apthorpe;
and Flora Sturtevant longed for the society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of Mr. Putnam. Being unable to compass their
desires, the two were forced to look to each other for
consolation, and went strolling among the rocks in an
aimless fashion. Flora had known Frank too well to
waste upon him those coquetries which she lavished
upon his uncle. They had been neighbors in their
young days, and had at various times been useful to
each other: they had reached a period of intimacy
where many of the fictions which disguise the true purposes
of conversation were between them laid aside,
although it is doubtful if they were the more honest in
consequence.</p>

<p>The two strolled for some distance in comparative
silence. Flora stopped at length by a rock which the
waves had fashioned into the rude likeness of a seat;
and here she seated herself with a deft adjustment of
the blue draperies of her yachting dress. "She gets
herself up well," her companion mused. "She certainly
doesn't look a day older than she did five years
ago."</p>

<p>"Frank," the lady said, breaking the silence,
"wasn't it the Samoset and Brookfield stock that
Montfield people lost so heavily on?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, dropping upon the shingle.
"Uncle Tom has a small fortune in the bonds, if they
were worth any thing. Half the people in town got
bitten on it."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose the bonds could be bought for a
song."</p>

<p>"No doubt. Why? Are you going into railroad
speculation?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may," she said thoughtfully, looking out over
the sea, and letting the quiet of the afternoon envelop
them a moment. "If"&mdash;She watched a white sail
disappear over the horizon's rim, before she completed
her sentence. "If I only had a hold over uncle Jacob,
I'd make my fortune; but I haven't."</p>

<p>"How?" Breck asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I haven't, so <i>n'importe</i>. If there's
an opening, I'll tell you. What was it you had to tell
me, by the way?"</p>

<p>"I want help," he answered; "but I don't see how
you can help me. You have had some clever ideas,
though, before now."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" she returned, turning the rings upon her
white fingers. "Say on."</p>

<p>"It is about that Smithers woman."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Don't bother to pretend you don't
know, Flora. You can't expect me to be honest,
unless you are."</p>

<p>"Well," Miss Sturtevant smiled, "let us assume that
I do know who the Smithers woman is. An old friend
of your father, if I remember correctly."</p>

<p>"Bother!" he said impatiently. "Why do you
tease so to-day? Do you want me to relate all the
details of her disreputable relations with my father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Nothing disreputable," Flora exclaimed
with a deprecatory gesture of her small hands. "But
what about her now?"</p>

<p>"You've heard how madly fond of her old Mullen
became in his last days?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes: it was as romantic as it was improper."</p>

<p>"Mullen put into her hands papers which related
to my father's affairs, and I want them."</p>

<p>"It is strange how that woman held both your
father and Mr. Mullen," Miss Sturtevant said reflectively.
"I should like to see her."</p>

<p>She seemed to become more and more indifferent
as the conversation proceeded; while, in reality, reasons
of which Breck could know nothing, made her
intensely interested.</p>

<p>"She is at Samoset," Frank said. "You may see
her any day."</p>

<p>"And she has these papers?" Flora asked.</p>

<p>"No, she has not."</p>

<p>"Who has?"</p>

<p>"Will you help me get them?"</p>

<p>"If I can, of course I will."</p>

<p>"I'll make it worth your while," he said, taking out
his tablets.</p>

<p>He leaned towards her, and wrote a name before
her eyes, as if he feared to speak what some unseen
listener might overhear. Then, in answer to her puzzled
look, he added an explanatory word or two.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The afternoon sun was declining swiftly when the
party prepared to leave the beautiful cove. Many of
the elder people had gone, Mrs. Sanford among them,
the worthy dame having first come to the top of the
bank, and poured out a flood of directions to her
daughter, to all of which, an impartial historian is
compelled to add, Patty gave not the slightest heed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>A rope had been fastened to a tree standing near
the head of the path leading up the embankment, and
supplied the place of the broken rail. When Patty
was ready, a discussion arose how she should be got
up the steep. Putnam cut it short by taking her,
blushing as a modest maiden should, in his arms, and
climbing up with her, she assisting by clinging to the
rope.</p>

<p>"You are something of a load," he said, puffing as
they reached the top.</p>

<p>"I shall be as heavy as mother some day, I don't
doubt," she replied demurely; "but it isn't grateful
of you to speak of it, when I pulled you up by the
rope."</p>

<p>"You are not the first lady who has pulled a man
up by a rope," he replied, tucking her into the carriage
with great tenderness; "but they generally do it
by means of the hangman."</p>

<h2><a name="ChVI." id="ChVI.">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>CHIT-CHAT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> carriages followed in succession the
homeward road; the first contained Patty and
Putnam; the second Clarence Toxteth and Miss
Purdy; the third, Burleigh Blood and Flossy.</p>

<p>Young Blood found himself unexpectedly at his ease
with his companion. The awe he felt for her as a
stranger, and because of her quaint speech, had largely
worn away. Still he regarded her rather doubtfully,
as one looks at something dangerous to handle. Her
tiny figure, her quick, nervous motions, reminded him
constantly of a humming-bird, and he had a fearful if
vague sense of the danger of crushing her by the mere
force of his huge presence. The great honest fellow,
almost a giant, could have taken her up with one
hand, his gentlest movements seeming overpoweringly
forcible when exerted in behalf of his <i>petite</i> companion;
and of this he was unpleasantly conscious.</p>

<p>Burleigh had known Patty Sanford from childhood
in the way that everybody in Montfield knew everybody
else. They had been companions at school,
where Burleigh was only one of a dozen who believed
themselves ready to lay down their lives for the doctor's
daughter, or&mdash;a far greater proof of devotion&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
share with her their last apple, or handful of chestnuts.
It is true that the social status of the Bloods,
so far as such distinctions were marked in Montfield,
was below that of the Sanfords; and Miss Mullen
of Mullen House, the aristocrat of the village, wondered
that Patty could associate with everybody as
she did. But Patty, while secretly proud enough of
her family, was democratic at least in the treatment of
her admirers; and young Blood found as warm a welcome
at the doctor's cottage as did Clarence Toxteth.
With Patty, Burleigh was less shy than with any girl of
his acquaintance, and yet was far from being at his
ease, even in her presence. With her cousin, whom
he had known only a few weeks, he was at first painfully
diffident. Her manner so completely ignored
this shyness, however, that it was gradually wearing
away.</p>

<p>"I do hope Patty's ankle isn't hurt so that she can't
take her part in the theatricals," Flossy said as they
rode along.</p>

<p>"Dr. Sanford thought," he returned, "that is, he
said, she'd be all right in a week or so, if she'd keep
still."</p>

<p>"She never did keep still," answered Flossy. "But
I'll do my best to make her now. Did you ever play
in amateur theatricals?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, no! of course not."</p>

<p>"There's no of course about it; only of course
you'll play now. This bashful man, you know, is just
your part."</p>

<p>"This bashful man?" he repeated doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes! In this play, you know. Patty and I
both say you'll do it capitally."</p>

<p>In despite of her assurance that he knew, Burleigh
was painfully conscious that he did not; and, indeed,
her way of designating every thing as "this, you
know," or "that other, you know," was sufficiently
confusing.</p>

<p>"I have had such fun in theatricals!" Flossy ran
on, not noticing his puzzled expression. "We played
'Trying It On,' one Christmas, and I was Mr. Tittlebat.
I was so nervous, that I repeated stage-directions and
all. And such a time as I had to get a man's suit
small enough!"</p>

<p>Her companion involuntarily glanced from his own
figure to the tiny maiden by his side. She understood
the look, and burst into a gay laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I should have been lost in your
clothes," she cried. He blushed as red as the big
clover she had pinned in his buttonhole, and modestly
cast down his eyes.</p>

<p>"In that other, you know," she chattered on,
"they wanted me to take the part of Jane. That was
after I had been Mr. Tittlebat, and I felt insulted."</p>

<p>"Insulted? Why, because it wasn't a man's part?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! I don't like to act men's parts.
But I hunted and hunted and hunted, and it was forever
before I could find it; and then this was all it was.
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>.&mdash;Jane, bring my bonnet.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>.&mdash;That
will do, Jane. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Jane</span>.] Of course I
wouldn't take it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was there insulting in that?" asked Burleigh,
to whom the brevity of the part would have
been a strong recommendation.</p>

<p>"Why, in the first place I couldn't find it; and then,
when I did, it was only 'Exit Jane.' You wouldn't
want to exit all the time, would you? I wouldn't 'exit
Jane' for 'em."</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, laughing at her emphatic
speech; "it is just as anybody feels: but I think I'd
rather 'exit' than any thing else."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see 'Ruy Blas'?" Flossy asked.
"You ought to see that. All the ladies cry; or at least
they all take out their handkerchiefs: this man is so
cruel, you know. And it's lovely where she says,&mdash;she's
the queen, you know,&mdash;'Ruy Blas, I pity, I forgive,
and I love you!' Oh, it's too lovely for any thing."</p>

<p>"Is that the place where the ladies all take out their
handkerchiefs?"</p>

<p>"No, that isn't the time <i>I</i> cry."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Burleigh asked, his bashfulness forgotten.
"Because you have shed all your tears?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she answered. "But I never cry until
the music strikes up."</p>

<p>In the carriage before Burleigh's, theatrical matters
were also the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>"Of course, Patty can't take her part now," said
Emily Purdy.</p>

<p>"Then we shall have to put off our play until she
can," Clarence replied, somewhat to the discontent of
his companion, who wished to be asked to take the
part assigned to Patty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>A theatrical entertainment was to be given for the
benefit of the Unitarian Church; that edifice being,
so to speak, decidedly out at the elbows; and the
young people of the society were all much interested.</p>

<p>"Of course," Miss Purdy said rather spitefully,
"every thing must be put off for her. She needn't
have been flirting with Mr. Putnam. I wonder if she
is engaged to him."</p>

<p>Clarence should have been wise enough to let this
pass unanswered; but his annoyance got the better of
his prudence. He found it hard to forgive Patty's
rejection of his invitation to the picnic; and before
he thought he blurted out what he would instantly
have been glad to recall.</p>

<p>"Of course not. She told me she thought him an
old miser."</p>

<p>"Did she?" his companion cried, her eyes sparkling
maliciously. "I didn't think she'd abuse a person
behind his back, and then accept his invitations.
If you only knew what she said about you!"</p>

<p>But Toxteth, in spite of the slip he had made, was a
gentleman, and couldn't be brought to ask what Patty
had said about him; so that, as Miss Purdy hardly
thought it best to offer the information unsolicited, he
remained forever in ignorance of the careless remark
about his foppishness, which would have been envenomed
by the tongue of the mischief-maker who longed
to repeat it.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have told what Patty Sanford said,"
he remarked. "She didn't mean it. Indeed, I am
not sure but I said it, and she only assented. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
course it should never have been repeated. I beg
you'll forget it."</p>

<p>"I never forget any thing," laughed Emily; "but I
never should mention what was told me in confidence."</p>

<p>In the first carriage of the three, the lawyer and his
companion rode for some time in silence. Each was
endeavoring to imagine the thoughts of the other, and
each at the same time carrying on an earnest train of
reflections. With people in love, silence is often no
less eloquent than speech, and perhaps is more often
truly interpreted.</p>

<p>Mr. Putnam was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"You are twenty-one," he said, with no apparent
connection.</p>

<p>"I am twenty-one," she answered, not failing to
remark that the words showed that his thoughts had
been of her.</p>

<p>"A girl at twenty-one," he continued, "is old enough
to know her own mind."</p>

<p>"This girl at twenty-one certainly knows her own
mind."</p>

<p>"Humph! I suppose so&mdash;or thinks she does."</p>

<p>Another long silence followed, more intense than
before. Both were conscious of a secret excitement,&mdash;an
electric condition of the mental atmosphere.
At last Putnam, as if the question of ages was of the
most vital interest, spoke again.</p>

<p>"I am thirty-two," he said.</p>

<p>"You are thirty-two," she echoed.</p>

<p>"Do you think that so old?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"That depends"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, too old for marrying, say?"</p>

<p>"That depends too," she answered, her color
heightening, in spite of her determination not to look
conscious.</p>

<p>"To marry," he continued, "say,&mdash;for the sake
of example merely,&mdash;say a girl of twenty-one. You
ought to know what a lady of twenty-one would
think."</p>

<p>"I know a great deal that I should never think of
telling."</p>

<p>"But I am in earnest. You see this is an important
question."</p>

<p>"You had better ask the lady herself."</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> lady? I said <i>a</i> lady. Besides, as I said this
morning (pardon my repeating it), 'the little god of
love won't turn the spit&mdash;spit&mdash;spit.'"</p>

<p>"Of course you are not too old," Patty said with
a sudden flash of the eyes, "to marry a girl of twenty&mdash;if
she would accept you."</p>

<p>"I said twenty-one," he returned; "but the difference
isn't material. You've evaded the question.
What I want to get at is, wouldn't she think I was too
old to accept?"</p>

<p>"Not if she loved you."</p>

<p>"But if she didn't?"</p>

<p>"Why, then she wouldn't marry you, if you were
young as Hazard, as big as Burleigh, and as gorgeously
arrayed as Clarence Toxteth. You had best
not let any woman know, however, that you think her
love meaner than your own."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"A woman, if she loved a man at all, would find it
hard to forgive him for believing her unwilling to
share his bitter things as well as his sweet."</p>

<p>"Um! But suppose he thought it selfish to ask her
to share the bitter things?"</p>

<p>"That is like a man!" Patty said impatiently.
"But what nonsense we are talking! Won't it be
funny to hear Bathalina condole with me? She'll
quote 'Watts and Select' by the quantity, and sing
the most doleful minors about the house to cheer me
up. For every one of mother's signs she'll have a
verse of Scripture, or a hymn."</p>

<p>"There is as much variety in love," Mr. Putnam
said, returning to the subject they had been discussing,
"there is as much variety in love as in candy."</p>

<p>"And as much difference in taste," she retorted.
"For my part, I should hate a love that was half chalk
or flour. But I don't wish to talk of love. I hope
my friends will come and see me, now I am lame, or I
shall die of loneliness."</p>

<p>"I'll send the Breck boys over," the lawyer said.
"Hazard is very good company."</p>

<p>"Of course their uncle," she said demurely, "would
come to look after them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he replied. "But who would look
after their uncle?"</p>

<h2><a name="ChVII." id="ChVII.">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>A BUSINESS INTERVIEW.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> else Flora Sturtevant might or
might not be, she at least was energetic, and
what she had to do she did at once and with her
might. Although she returned from the picnic at
Mackerel Cove very weary, she did not rest until she
had written a dainty missive to Jacob Wentworth, the
brother of her late step-father. The answer came on
the evening of the following day in this telegram:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Will be in Boston Saturday. Come to office at twelve.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Jacob Wentworth.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It was to meet this appointment that Miss Sturtevant
passed leisurely down Milk Street about noon
Saturday. The signal-ball upon the Equitable Building
fell just as she passed the Old South Church; but
she seemed not disposed to quicken her steps.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jacob will be cross if he has to wait; but I
think I like him best a little cross. I wonder how
he'll act. I must make my cards tell: I never shall
hold a better hand, and the stake is worth playing for.
How tremendously hot it is! How do people live in
the city in August! Next summer I'll be at the seashore,
if this goes through all straight. I shall be
independent of everybody then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Musing in this agreeable fashion, Miss Flora turned
the corner of Congress Street, and walked on until she
entered one of those noble buildings which have
sprung up since the great fire, making Boston's business
streets among the finest in the world. Miss
Sturtevant adjusted her dress a little in the elevator,
looked to the buttons of her gloves, and glanced over
her general trigness, as might an admiral about to go
into action. An inward smile softened her lips without
disturbing their firmness, as she entered an office
upon the glass of whose door was inscribed her uncle's
name.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, uncle Jacob," she said brightly.</p>

<p>A white-haired man, with small, shrewd eyes which
twinkled beneath bushy brows, looked up from the
letter he was writing. His forehead was high and
retreating, his nose suggestive of good dinners; and
his whole bearing had that firmness only obtained by
the use as a tonic of the elixir of gold. Flora had
been from childhood forbidden to address him as
uncle, and he understood at once that she felt sure of
her ground to-day, or she would not have ventured
upon the term. The lawyer paused almost perceptibly
before he answered her salutation.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said. "Sit down."</p>

<p>"Thanks," answered the visitor, leisurely seating
herself. "This office is so much nicer than your old
one! I hope you are well, uncle."</p>

<p>"I am well enough," he returned gruffly. "What
is this wonderful business which brings you to Boston?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know I always do you a good turn when I
can," remarked Miss Sturtevant by way of introduction.</p>

<p>"Yes," he assented. "You find it pays."</p>

<p>"You may or may not remember," she went on
with great deliberation, "that you once requested me
to discover for you&mdash;or for a client, you said&mdash;what
became of certain papers which you drew up for Mr.
Mullen of Montfield."</p>

<p>"I remember," the other said, his eyes twinkling
more than ever.</p>

<p>"I had hard work enough," Flora continued, "to
trace them as far as I did, and little gratitude I got for
my pains."</p>

<p>"You did not discover where the papers were?"</p>

<p>"I found that they had been in the possession of
Mrs. Smithers."</p>

<p>"Her name," Mr. Wentworth remarked, pressing
softly together the tips of his plump fingers, "is not
Mrs. Smithers. She never married. It is best to be
exact."</p>

<p>"Miss Clemens, then," said Flora. "I know now
where those papers are."</p>

<p>"You do?" the old lawyer cried, at last showing
some excitement. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>"That is my secret," she answered, with the faintest
smile, and a nod of her head. "When is that directors'
meeting?"</p>

<p>"Next Tuesday," replied Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p>He knew his interlocutor well enough to allow her
to take her own way in the conversation, fully aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that she would not idly turn from the subject in
hand.</p>

<p>"And you then decide whether to buy the Samoset
and Brookfield Branch?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Do you object to telling me how
you discovered that?"</p>

<p>"I have my living to earn," she answered, smiling,
"and it is necessary that I keep my eyes and ears open.
Could you promise me, if you chose, that the decision
should be to buy the Samoset and Brookfield Branch?"</p>

<p>"If I chose, I dare say I could," the lawyer affirmed.
"My own vote, and others upon which I can count, will
turn the scale."</p>

<p>"Very well. Do you accept my terms?"</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed Wentworth, slapping his
palm upon his knee. "What a long head you have,
Flora! You are like your mother, and she was a
devilish smart woman, or she wouldn't have married
my brother."</p>

<p>"It would have been to my advantage," Flora said,
"if she had taken him for her first husband, instead
of her second. Those precious half-sisters of mine
would hardly hold their heads so high now, if she had.
But do you agree?"</p>

<p>"If I understand," he said, "you offer me your
information for my vote."</p>

<p>"For your assurance," she corrected, "that the
vote is affirmative."</p>

<p>"What is your game?" demanded the old man.
"What assurance have I that your information is
correct?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only my word," she said coolly. "I will tell you
the name of the person having those papers, and where
that person is to be found, the day I have proof that
the affirmative vote is passed. You do as you like
about accepting my terms."</p>

<p>It is needless to narrate further the conversation
between the two: suffice it to say that Miss Flora
was in the end triumphant. The wily lawyer determined
to find his own account in the purposed vote,
by the immediate purchase of Samoset and Brookfield
Railroad stocks. One question Miss Sturtevant asked
before she left the office.</p>

<p>"Had these papers any relation to Mr. Breck or
his property?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," Mr. Wentworth answered, evidently surprised.
"What put that into your head?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said. "Good-morning."</p>

<p>And the enterprising woman, going to the bank,
drew every dollar she could raise, and then hastened
to catch the afternoon train to Montfield.</p>

<p>"Frank Breck," she said to herself, as she rolled
along, "you are hardly a match for me, after all."</p>

<p>Within the next few days Miss Flora was very busy.
She astonished the business-men of Samoset, a village
half a dozen miles west of Montfield, by going about,
purchasing the old Samoset and Brookfield stock,
which everybody knew to be worthless, and which
was to be had for a song. The lady was full of a
thousand affectations and kittenish wiles in her leisure
hours; but, when attending to business, she showed
the hard, shrewd nature which lay beneath this soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
exterior. She drove sharp bargains, and when, at last,
the vote of the directors of the great Brookfield Valley
Railroad to purchase the Branch became known, Miss
Sturtevant's name was in every mouth, not always
uncoupled with curses. Many a man and woman
whose all had been sunk in the Branch found it hard
to forgive this woman for the advantage she had taken;
and she was accused of a sharpness not to be clearly
distinguished from dishonesty; for country people see
stock operations in a light very different from that of
Wall Street. That Flora was not without consideration
for the property of others, however, is proved by the
following note, which she wrote the Sunday after her
interview with Mr. Wentworth:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Putnam</span>,&mdash;My interest in your welfare is too
deep for me to stop to consider how you will regard my writing
you. I heard in Boston yesterday, that the stock of the Samoset
and Brookfield is likely to increase in value very soon. I
tell you this <i>in strictest confidence</i>, as I have heard it intimated
that you own some of the stock.</p>

<p>
Very sincerely yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Flora Sturtevant</span>.<br />

<h2><a name="ChVIII." id="ChVIII.">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>ON THE PIAZZA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of Bathalina Clemens was one long wail
in the past-potential tense. "I might have
been" was the refrain of all her days.</p>

<p>"I might ha' been Peter Mixon's wife, if my sinful
pride hadn't a made me high-minded," she said continually.
"How'd I know he'd give up so easily,
'cause I said I wouldn't let him lick the ground I
walked on?"</p>

<p>The nasal melancholy of camp-meeting minors
floated after her angular form like the bitter odor from
wormwood or tansy. She reproved the levity of those
about her with an inner satisfaction at having "borne
testimony;" and particularly did she labor with Patty,
whose high spirits were a continual thorn to Bathalina.</p>

<p>"It's so like the Amorites and the Hittites and
Hivites," she groaned, "to be always singing and
laughing and dancing about! How'll you feel when
you come to your latter end? Would you dance on
your dying-bed?"</p>

<p>"Probably not," Patty answered, laughing more than
ever; "but I can't tell."</p>

<p>The spraining of Patty's ankle seemed to Bathalina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a direct visitation of Providence in reproof for her
vain merry-making.</p>

<p>"I knew some judgment would happen to you,"
the servant said. "'My sinfulness has been visited
upon me.' If you'd only live as you'll wish you had
when you come to stand around your dying-bed!"</p>

<p>"Bathalina," Patty said sedately, "I am glad you
mention it. I intend to behave until my ankle gets
better; and I wanted to ask you if you'd mind taking
my place in the theatricals we are getting up."</p>

<p>"You may mock now," retorted Bathalina wrathfully;
"but at the last you'll bite like an adder, and
sting like a serpent.&mdash;Mrs. Sanford, I came to tell you
that I am going this afternoon to the funeral of my
cousin Sam's first wife's child."</p>

<p>"Is she dead?" asked Mrs. Sanford. "I hadn't
heard of it; though, now, I remember I did hear a
dog howl night before last."</p>

<p>"I suppose she's dead," the servant answered;
"because, when I was over there Saturday, Jane said
to me, says she, 'We sha'n't churn till after Emma
dies.' And she wouldn't ha' said that if she warn't
a-goin' to die soon. And, as that family always has
their funerals Wednesday, I thought I better go over."</p>

<p>"But to-night is bread night," Mrs. Sanford objected;
while Patty sank back in convulsions of
laughter.</p>

<p>"Well'm, I'll mix it up early to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"No," the housewife said decidedly; "none of
your bread raised by daylight in my house. I'll see
to it myself to-night. Grandmother Sanford is coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to-day; and she knows what good bread is, if anybody
does."</p>

<p>"Mother," Patty asked, as the door closed behind
Bathalina, "do you suppose Bath is as crazy as she
seems? She talks like a perfect idiot."</p>

<p>"Well," her mother answered meditatively, "sometimes
I think that perhaps maybe she isn't; and
then, again, I don't know but after all I can't tell but
she is."</p>

<p>Later in the forenoon Patty lay upon a light willow
lounge which Will had placed for her on the piazza.
It was a lovely summer's day. The bees hummed
drowsily among the flowers, and Patty had drifted
halfway from waking into sleeping. Through an
opening in the vines which shaded the piazza, she
watched the clouds moving slowly through the far, still
spaces of blue ether, one shape insensibly changing
into another as they passed.</p>

<p>The girl was thinking of nothing higher or greater
than her suitors, perhaps having meditated sufficiently
upon graver subjects in the days since her accident,
now making almost a week. She was not counting
her conquests; yet she had a pleasant consciousness
of her power, and recalled with satisfaction the compliments
bestowed upon her in words or attentions.
The two nephews of Mr. Putnam, Frank and Hazard
Breck, had the previous afternoon called upon
her; and the younger was of old a devoted worshipper
at her shrine. Hazard Breck was a fine,
manly fellow a year Patty's junior. He believed himself
madly in love with her; and indeed, in the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of pure-minded youth, he felt for her that maiden
passion which is light and sweetness without the heat
and wholesome bitter of a man's love.</p>

<p>As Patty lay watching the clouds, and enjoying the
colors brought out by the sunlight as it filtered
through the leafy screen, she heard the latch of the
gate click. Without turning her head, she tried to
guess whose step it was coming up the gravel-walk,
and rightly concluded it must be that of Hazard
Breck. He crossed the piazza, and came to her side.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said, in a tone having something
of the richness of his uncle's voice. "Are you
asleep, or awake?"</p>

<p>"Asleep," she answered, closing her eyes. "Isn't
it a delicious morning to sleep and dream?"</p>

<p>"What do you dream?"</p>

<p>"That you have good news to tell."</p>

<p>"You are no witch to guess that. You knew it
from my voice."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Now I can torment you," he said, "as you did
me last night. Guess."</p>

<p>"One never guesses in sleep."</p>

<p>"Dream it, then."</p>

<p>"I should dream that the sky had fallen, and you
had caught larks."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't, worse luck. But you'll never get
it."</p>

<p>"Then tell me."</p>

<p>"It is about uncle Tom," he said after some further
bantering. "He's had a windfall. The Samoset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and Brookfield stock has gone up like a rocket, and
made his fortune. Isn't that jolly!"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about stocks," she answered; "but
I'm glad he's made his fortune."</p>

<p>"I'm just wild over it!" Hazard said. "It is so
opportune!"</p>

<p>"Did he need it so much, then?" Patty asked, with
a secret consciousness that she was pumping her
guest.</p>

<p>"Uncle Tom is so generous!" Breck answered.</p>

<p>"He has not usually had that reputation," she returned,
dropping the words slowly, one by one.</p>

<p>"I know," he said indignantly. "Of course I've
no right to tell it, because he has always insisted that
I should not. But I'd like you, at least, to know, and
it can't do any harm to tell you now. He has supported
not only aunt Pamela, but Frank and me; and
of course, with two of us in college, it has been a hard
pull on him."</p>

<p>"But I should think," she began, "that"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That we wouldn't have let him?" Hazard said as
she hesitated. "I wonder&mdash;I've always wondered
that we did. But he insisted, and said we could pay
him back when we got our professions; and so we
shall, of course."</p>

<p>Patty was silent. She was filled with self-reproach
for having misjudged the lawyer. Why, from all her
suitors, her heart had chosen this elderly-looking man,
his hair already threaded with gray, she could have
told as little as any one else. Love as a rule is so
illogical, that it is strange the ancients did not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the little god the female sex; though it is true they
approximated toward it by representing him eternally
blindfold. Something in Patty had instinctively recognized
the innate nobility of Mr. Putnam's character,
hidden beneath a somewhat cold exterior. Against
the fascination which his personality exercised over
her, she struggled as a strong will always struggles
against the dominion of a stronger. She could not
easily yield herself up, and often treated the lawyer
with less tenderness, or even courtesy, than the rest of
her suitors. At the revelations of Hazard, however,
she was much softened; and had Tom Putnam been at
hand&mdash;but he was not; and it is idle to speculate
upon chances, albeit the whole world is poised upon
an <span class="smcap">IF</span>, as a rocking-stone upon its pivot.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIX." id="ChIX.">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>AN ARRIVAL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> silence of the pair upon the piazza was
broken by the arrival at the gate of Will, who
had been to the station to meet grandmother Sanford.
Patty started up as if to run to meet her, but
fell back.</p>

<p>"I forget that I am a cripple," she said.</p>

<p>"Mother, how do you do?" exclaimed Mrs. Sanford,
appearing in the doorway. "Do come up on to the
piazza. I don't want to meet you on the stairs, or I'll
have a disappointment."</p>

<p>"Thee art as full of foolish superstitions as ever,
daughter Britann," the old lady said, coming slowly
up the steps on Will's arm.</p>

<p>"You dear little grandmother!" Patty cried. "How
glad I am you've come!"</p>

<p>"I am glad to come," her grandmother answered,
"and grieved much to find thee lame. How dost
thee do to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm nicely. My ankle isn't painful at all.
It would have been well if I could have kept still.
This is Hazard Breck, grandmother, Mr. Putnam's
nephew; you remember him.&mdash;And this, Hazard, is
the nicest grandmother that ever lived."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thee art the nephew of an honest man," the old
lady said, "though he is somewhat given to irreverent
speech."</p>

<p>"He is the best of uncles, at least," Hazard answered
warmly.</p>

<p>"He is a very respectable old gentleman," Mrs.
Sanford said patronizingly.</p>

<p>Will laughed meaningly, and glanced at his sister,
whose cheeks flushed. Mrs. Sanford's antipathy to
the lawyer was no secret.</p>

<p>"Mr. Putnam is the finest man I know," Patty said,
a trifle defiantly, "except my father."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Will said teasingly. "Grandmother,"
he added, "I think it is all nonsense about Patty's
ankle. She only makes believe, so as to have everybody
come and see her. She has a regiment of callers
about the house all the time."</p>

<p>"Hazard," Patty said, "if mother has no objections,
I wish you'd please toss Will into that bed of
pinks."</p>

<p>"Objections!" exclaimed Mrs. Sanford. "Of
course I've objections. Your own brother and the
most thrifty bed of pinks I've got! Patience Sanford,
I'm surprised at you!"</p>

<p>"If thee hast no objection, daughter Britann,"
grandmother Sanford said with her quiet smile, "I'll
go in and rest a little."</p>

<p>The old lady was the mother of Dr. Sanford and
of Mrs. Plant. She was a woman of strong character,
and had adopted the Quaker faith after her marriage,
being converted to it by the labors of a woman who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had nursed her through a long illness. In her youth,
grandmother Sanford had perhaps been somewhat
stern, as people of strong wills are apt to be: but age
had mellowed her, as it does all sound fruit; and now
she was so beloved by her friends and relatives, that
they were ready to quarrel for her society to such a
degree, that she declared she lived "on the circuit."
She had keen perceptions, a quick sense of the ludicrous,
and a kindly heart, which endeared her to all.
Even Mrs. Sanford, who was undemonstrative in her
affection for everybody else, brightened visibly whenever
her mother-in-law came, and showed her pleasure
in numerous kindly attentions. As for Patty, she
worshipped her grandmother, who understood her as
no one else but Dr. Sanford did. It was a peculiarity
of the girl's to make few confidences; but to her
grandmother she would talk of matters which she
mentioned to no one else. Nor was the old lady less
proud and fond of her grand-daughter; and the love
between them was, as is always love between youth
and age, a most beautiful thing to see.</p>

<p>Patty and Hazard Breck were scarcely left alone on
the piazza, when a new visitor appeared, in the person
of Burleigh Blood. The young man had been to the
depot to see about the freight of the products of the
dairy-farm which he owned in company with his
father, and had chosen to improve his opportunity
by calling at the Sanford cottage. At sight of him,
young Breck said good-by, and betook himself home
by a short cut across the garden, much to Patty's
disappointment, as she wished to hear further concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his uncle's good fortune. She, however, sped the
parting, and welcomed the coming guest with a smile;
and the young farmer sat bashfully on the steps of the
piazza before her.</p>

<p>"How big you are, Burleigh!" she said, glancing
admiringly over his breadth of shoulder and chest, the
strong head, and the firm, large hands.</p>

<p>"You told me that the other day," he said ruefully;
"but I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Help it? Of course not. What makes you think
I meant any thing but praise?"</p>

<p>"I thought I was so big and clumsy, that you must
be making fun of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I was only thinking what a mere morsel
Flossy looked beside you at the picnic."</p>

<p>He blushed, and pulled at his hat, after his usual
awkward fashion; and at that moment, as if summoned
by a call-boy for her part in the play, Flossy
herself appeared in the doorway, bowl of pop-corn,
and all.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Blood," she said. "Can you
tell why mutton always tastes catty? As if it were cats,
I mean."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never tasted any cats," he said with the
utmost earnestness.</p>

<p>"No? Well, I wouldn't. But why didn't you come
to inquire how I felt after the picnic? Montfield
manners and bonnets both need to be issued in a
revised edition."</p>

<p>"Montfield manners are perfect," Patty said, coming
to the rescue of the guest. "They cannot be improved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
But you remember, Flossy, what you had to ask Burleigh."</p>

<p>"Of course you understand, Mr. Blood," Flossy
said, "that a lady's request is a command."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly."</p>

<p>"Very well. It is this I spoke to you about the
other day, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't remember what you mean."</p>

<p>"You are to be my lover in this play."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You don't look over-charmed at the prospect,"
Flossy remarked coolly. "You ought to feel honored.
So saying, I will eat a few kernels of corn.
Have some, Patty?"</p>

<p>"But of course I can't act."</p>

<p>"Of course you can. I'll get the book for you now,
so you can be studying your part. We don't have
rehearsal until next week."</p>

<p>"You are to be Jonathan Cowboy in the play,"
Flossy continued, having produced the book. "Will
is Mr. Bramble, and Ease Apthorpe his daughter. I'm
to be Waitstill Eastman. I chose that because she
has things to eat."</p>

<p>"Shall you eat pop-corn?" asked Patty.</p>

<p>"Really, I couldn't think of taking a part," Burleigh
said.</p>

<p>"Nobody wants you to think of it," Flossy returned
placidly. "It is settled that you are to have it. It is
a bashful part, and, if you make any mistakes, people
will think it is part of the play."</p>

<p>"'Vanity of vanities,'" said the voice of Bathalina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Clemens, who had approached unperceived. "'All is
vanity.'"</p>

<p>"So are you," Flossy retorted.</p>

<p>"How came you home so soon?" Patty asked.
"Didn't they have the funeral?"</p>

<p>"No," the doleful servant answered. "Emma ain't
dead: so they had to put it off. Jane concluded to
do her churning, after all; but she says she's in hopes
to get through the burying by next Wednesday. And
I should think she'd want to; for that'll finish up all
the first wife's children. It'll naturally give her more
time to look after her own."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear any thing so atrocious!" exclaimed
Patty, as the maid-servant disappeared round
the corner of the house. "The way she talks about
that funeral is more crazy than her usual speeches,
and that is certainly needless."</p>

<p>"Don't names," Flossy asked pensively, "always
convey a color to your mind, Mr. Blood?"</p>

<p>"Convey a color?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Like Caroline, you know: that always makes
me think of pale yellow, and Susan of red, and Mary
of blue."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" laughed her cousin. "What
color would Bathalina suggest?"</p>

<p>"That name," said Flossy, "always calls up a
grayish, dirty green, like faded linsey-woolsey."</p>

<p>And at that moment the dinner-bell rang.</p>

<h3>A CHANCE MEETING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Putnam mansion, wherein the lawyer's ancestors
had lived and died for several generations,
stood next to the cottage of Dr. Sanford; or rather
the two places were back to back, each facing one of
the two principal of the village streets. To reach
either house from the more distant thoroughfare, a
short cut was taken across the grounds of the other,
right-of-way being conceded by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>People in Montfield retired early; and thus it happened
that at ten o'clock of the Friday night following
the coming of grandmother Sanford the lights
were out in the doctor's cottage, and sleep was supposed
to have descended upon all the dwellers therein.
Patty had not, however, retired. A thunder-storm
was slowly rising out of the west, with golden fringes
of lightning about its dark edges; and she sat at her
open window to watch its progress. The unusual
restraint imposed upon her by her lameness had made
her restless; and she longed to steal out of the house,
and run races across the orchard as she had done
when a child. The sultry closeness of the night made
her take a fan, with which she did little but tap impatiently
upon the window-ledge. She was not thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
connectedly, but in a vague way unpleasant thoughts
and feelings crowded tumultuously through her brain
like the crew of Comus.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the garden below she heard voices. A
man was speaking earnestly, but in a tone too low to
be audible at the window above. A woman answered
him, the pair seeming to discuss something with
much emphasis. Her curiosity greatly excited by so
unusual a circumstance, Patty leaned out of the window
to discover, if possible, who were the speakers.</p>

<p>"Well, it's the Lord's will," she heard the woman's
voice say. "And I, for one, ain't a-going to run a
muck agin it."</p>

<p>"It is Bathalina!" the listener said to herself.
"Who in the world can she be talking to?"</p>

<p>She leaned farther from her window, but by an
unlucky movement of her arm sent her fan fluttering
down to the gravel walk below. The speakers departed
in different directions like phantoms, and Patty was
left once again to her own reflections. At first she
speculated upon the possible nature of the interview
she had interrupted; then her thoughts came back to
her fan. It chanced to be one painted by an artist-cousin,
and one of which she was fond: a thunder-storm
was rapidly approaching, and the fan likely to be
ruined. Her ankle was fast recovering, and she was
not long in determining to go down into the garden
for her property. With the aid of the furniture and
the stair-railings she got safely down to the side-door,
cautiously unbolted it and slipped out. The fan was
only a few steps from the door, but a rolling-stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
lay in wait for the lame ankle, and gave it so severe a
turn that Patty sank down a miserable heap upon the
ground. She sat there a moment to recover herself,
and then crawled back to the door-steps. Seated
here, she gazed ruefully at the fan, a white spot upon
the dusky walk, and, coddling her aching ankle in her
hands, wondered how she was to regain her room.</p>

<p>At that moment brisk steps sounded on the walk,
approaching the spot where she sat. A tall form
defined itself amid the darkness, pausing before her.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said the voice of Tom Putnam.
"Is it you, Patty?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is I."</p>

<p>"Would it be polite to ask if you walk in your
sleep?"</p>

<p>"I can't walk awake at any rate," she replied, half
laughing and half crying, "whatever I may do in my
sleep."</p>

<p>"Then, you must have come here for air in your
dreams."</p>

<p>"I came after that fan, and I've twisted my foot
over again."</p>

<p>He restored the fan, and then seated himself at her
feet on the lowest step.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate I took this way home," he said
coolly. "I hear that you think I am miserly."</p>

<p>"What?" she exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>"I am told that you pronounce me miserly," he
repeated. "I am very sorry, for I mean to ask you
to be my wife."</p>

<p>Instead of answering this strange declaration, Patty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
covered her face with her hands and burst into tears.
He laid his fingers lightly upon her hair, smoothing
it with a caressing motion. Surprise, physical pain,
anger, and love were all oddly mingled in Patty's
mind. She knew that she loved this man, and she
was bitterly angry with herself for having misjudged
him. She was no less angry with him for knowing the
latter fact, of which Emily Purdy had taken care that
he should not remain ignorant. She had, too, that
Amazonian repugnance to the caress of a lover which
is often inborn in strong personalities. She shook off
the lawyer's touch as if it were fire.</p>

<p>"I misjudged you," she said, by an angry effort
controlling her tears, "and I am not too proud to own
it. Now forget it."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "it is forgotten. But your
opinion is every thing to me, for I have loved you
these dozen years, Patty. I've watched you growing
up, and loved you more and more every year. I've
had the words in my mouth a hundred times; but
now I am able to marry, and I ask you to be my
wife."</p>

<p>However cool these words may seem in black and
white, they were intense as Tom Putnam spoke them,
his rich voice gathering force as he proceeded. He
was moved from that calm which Flossy Plant declared
to be an essential law of his existence. The passion
he felt was too old, too well defined, to come stammering
and broken from his tongue; but his voice trembled,
and he bent forward until his hot breath touched
her cheek. He did not again attempt to caress her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
but she felt that his eyes were fixed upon her with a
keenness that could almost pierce the darkness. Still
her mood was a defensive one. That she fought against
herself no less than against him, only added strength
to her determination not to yield.</p>

<p>"You had little faith in the depth of my love," she
said at last, after a silence which seemed to both very
long, "if you thought I should be afraid of poverty
with you."</p>

<p>"Then you do love me!" he exclaimed, in joyous,
vibrating tones.</p>

<p>"I did not say so," she retorted quickly. "I was
talking of your feelings, not mine."</p>

<p>"I had no right to ask you to share poverty," he
said. "I loved you too well to do it."</p>

<p>"That is because you looked only at your own
side," she persisted. "If I loved a man, I should be
glad if he were poor. I should delight to show him
that I loved him better than any thing money would
buy. Oh! I should be proud and glad to work for
him if I need&mdash;and you thought I wouldn't do
it!"</p>

<p>He caught her hand, and kissed it passionately.</p>

<p>"You know it is not that," he said. "I never
thought any thing of you but that you were the noblest
woman I knew; but I was not worth so much
hardship&mdash;I couldn't bring it on you. But since you
love me, I can wait."</p>

<p>"I never said I loved you! I&mdash;I don't."</p>

<p>"I know better," said he, springing up; "but let
that go. It is beginning to rain, and sentiment must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
give place to reason. How shall you get into the
house?"</p>

<p>"But you must not go away thinking I love you,"
she said weakly.</p>

<p>"How can you help it?" he returned. "How
shall you get back to your room?"</p>

<p>"If I only could wake Flossy, she'd help me."</p>

<p>"Which is her window?"</p>

<p>"The one over the rosebush."</p>

<p>He took up a handful of pebbles, and threw them
lightly against the panes until Flossy came to the
window.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" she called timidly.</p>

<p>"It's I," Patty answered. "Come down."</p>

<p>"What on earth!" began Flossy.</p>

<p>"Come quick, and keep quiet."</p>

<p>"She is coming," Putnam said. "Good-night,
Patty. If you knew how I love you!"</p>

<p>He kissed her hand again, and was gone just in time
to escape Flossy.</p>

<p>"How did you hit my window from the door-step?"
the latter asked as the two girls climbed slowly the
stairs.</p>

<p>"By sleight of hand," her cousin answered. "Good-night.
Thank you very much. I want to get to bed
and to sleep before it begins to lighten any worse."</p>

<p>But how could she sleep with those two kisses burning
like live coals upon her hand?</p>

<h2><a name="ChXI." id="ChXI.">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3>A BUNDLE OF PAPERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Patty</span> slept late the following morning, and before
she was well awake the sense of something
strange and sad was present in her mind. She opened
her eyes, and slowly recalled the conversation of the
previous night, with the most mingled feelings. That
Tom Putnam loved her was a new, keen joy; but
bitter indeed was it to remember how she had met the
proffer of his heart. It was true he had not accepted
her negative; but all the combativeness of the girl's
disposition was aroused, and she felt something of the
martyr spirit of men determined to die for a cause
they know lost or hopeless. She felt that nothing
would make her retract her denial; that she could not
do so and retain her self-respect. And yet an inner
double-consciousness knew that some time she meant
to yield, and that she hoped for some fortunate turn
of circumstances to bring about the means of graceful
submission.</p>

<p>She dressed herself slowly and sadly, until, catching
sight of her lugubrious face in the glass, she laughed
in spite of herself, and determined to shake off her
melancholy.</p>

<p>She descended to breakfast humming a gay air, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
trying to appear as if she were no more lame than
upon the day previous. No one but grandmother
Sanford noticed that her gayety was forced; but the
beautiful old Friend with silvery hair and snowy kerchief
possessed a shrewd head and a tender heart,
quick to detect and to sympathize with pain.</p>

<p>"Grand-daughter," she said after breakfast, when
they were alone together, "something troubleth thee."</p>

<p>"Me, grandmother?" Patty began with affected
surprise. But there was about the other a candor
which enforced frankness in return. "It is nothing
that can be helped," Patty said, sighing, "and indeed
it is nothing to tell of."</p>

<p>"Thee must have confidence in thy grandmother,
Patience, if so be that I can ever serve thee."</p>

<p>"I shall, I do. Grandmother, I"&mdash;</p>

<p>The door opened, and admitted Flossy and her
aunt.</p>

<p>"I can trust the maid to clean the parlor," Mrs.
Sanford was saying impressively; "but the cellar I
must see to myself."</p>

<p>"Yes," Flossy returned, "and that reminds me,
Aunt Britann: can you tell why a cat's breath always
smells fishy?"</p>

<p>"It cleared off in the night," her aunt continued,
without taking the slightest notice of the whimsical
question, "and so ain't likely to stay pleasant."</p>

<p>"Beech-nuts," Flossy said in the same rambling
way, "used to be good to eat in school, they took up
so much time. But then they have a sort of apologetic
taste, as if they'd be bigger if they could."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"And horse-chestnuts," added her aunt, "are so
good for rheumatism."</p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried Patty. "Are you both insane?
You talk like two crazy Janes."</p>

<p>"I'd like to be a crazy Jane," Flossy said reflectively.
"I wonder what they eat? Grandmother, did
you bring those old-fashioned things with you? We
are counting on them for our play. So saying, I
gracefully fling myself into a chair. I think I could
wear your dresses, grandmother."</p>

<p>"I brought them," the old lady answered with a
twinkle in her eye. "Though I fear 'tis encouraging
thee in vain and frivolous follies."</p>

<p>"If we don't go into vain and frivolous follies until
you encourage them," Patty cried, "we may live to
grow as solemn as Bathalina herself."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," Flossy put in, "that Mademoiselle
Clemens has a dreadful 'hark-from-the-tombs-a-doleful-sound'
air this morning."</p>

<p>"Why"&mdash;her cousin began, as there flashed through
her mind the remembrance of the interview she had
interrupted on the previous night. Her own troubles
had until now driven it out of her mind.</p>

<p>"Well, what?" Flossy asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Let's look at the dresses now. Can't
Flossy get them, grandmother?"</p>

<p>The costumes were produced in a hair-covered
trunk which Flossy and Mrs. Sanford with some difficulty
dragged into the sitting-room. When it was
opened, a delightful odor of lavender and camphor
and sweet-grass was diffused through the air; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
grew more and more pungent as from the trunk were
taken delicious old gowns of Canton crape, broidered
kerchiefs, caps, and hand-bags.</p>

<p>"That corn-colored crape is just the thing for me,"
Patty cried. "Isn't it lovely! Oh, you vain old
grandmother! you are as gray as a sparrow now, but
you used to go arrayed in purple and fine linen."</p>

<p>"I was not weaned from the worldliness of fine
dress then," the old lady said, smiling. "And they
did say," she added, smoothing her dove-gray dress
with innocent complacency, "that I was not uncomely
in those days."</p>

<p>"You are the handsomest mother in the State now,"
said Dr. Sanford, who had entered. "Patty, what is
that bundle of papers?"</p>

<p>A packet of papers yellowed by age lay in the
bottom of the trunk, and Patty took them up.</p>

<p>"Some of the letters grandmother had in her philandering
days, I suppose. Shall I open them, grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Give them to me. Thee art a sad, giddy girl,
grand-daughter.&mdash;They are old papers of thy father's,
Charles. I haven't seen them this forty years for aught
I know."</p>

<p>"Let me see them, mother," Dr. Sanford said.
"This is father's land-grant for serving in the war of
1812."</p>

<p>"I never knew grandfather was in the war of 1812,"
said Patty. "Was he wounded?"</p>

<p>"Wounded," repeated grandmother Sanford, laughing.
"There came a report that the British were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
coming to Quinnebasset where he lived, and a company
of men was raised. They went down to Edgecomb,
and had a camp for four or five weeks, and
then came home again."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The king of France, with forty thousand men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marched up a hill, and then marched down again,'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Dr. Sanford.</p>

<p>"But, grandmother," Flossy said, "you must have
been awfully frightened to have him in danger."</p>

<p>"There was no danger. The men camped out,
and spent their time in riotous living I fear. At
least the British were not within hundreds of miles of
them."</p>

<p>"But they might have come. I should have lain
awake nights fearing something would happen, if it
had been my husband."</p>

<p>"I think I did not lie awake nights much," grandmother
answered, smiling. "I was but eight years old,
and did not know that there was such a person in
the world as William Sanford. It was before my father
removed his family to Quinnebasset."</p>

<p>"But, mother," Dr. Sanford said, "you must be
entitled to a pension as the widow of a veteran of the
war of 1812. I'd forgotten all about father's being
mustered in. This land-grant is evidence enough to
show that he was."</p>

<p>"O grandmother!" put in Patty. "Now I shall
begin to behave, so as to be remembered in your will."</p>

<p>"I am little in favor of receiving money obtained
by bloodshed, son Charles, as thee knowest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, mother. There was no blood shed.
The money will be clean of any taint of war according
to your own story. The money won't hurt you:
you know you are only half Friend, when all's said
and done."</p>

<p>And, after much laughter and joking, it was decided
that the matter should be put into the hands of Mr.
Putnam.</p>

<p>Many were the allusions made to the grandmother's
pension, and out of the matter came several odd
incidents as will in due time appear.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXII." id="ChXII.">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>AN AFTERNOON RIDE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> quiet which falls upon a country village
after its noonday meal, brooded over Montfield.
Only the great butterflies and the bees were
stirring, except for a humming-bird that now and then
darted among the flowers. Patty and Flossy were
together upon the piazza, lazily discussing matters
relating to the theatrical entertainment, when a buggy
stopped at the gate, from which descended the huge
form of Burleigh Blood.</p>

<p>"Now, Burleigh," Patty cried, as he approached,
and before he had time to say more than good-day,
"I know you've come to take Flossy to drive, but I
want to go myself. It is too lovely for any thing this
afternoon, and I am an invalid and must be humored,
you know."</p>

<p>"If I could ever see that mushrooms had any taste,"
Flossy said deliberately, but with no discoverable connection,
"I am sure I should be fond of them: so I
always eat them, and think what a good time I am
having if I only knew it."</p>

<p>"Flossy, you get to be more and more incomprehensible
every day. Sit down, Burleigh, please. Of
course you'll have to take me to ride."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is what I came for," he answered.</p>

<p>He did not, however, tell the truth. He had come
intending to ask Flossy; but somehow his invitations
always seemed to get crossed at the Sanfords', and he
fated to be the sport of adverse fortune. He had
reasoned out in his honest head a profound scheme of
diplomacy. He would pique Patty by his attentions
to her cousin, and thus force her to treat him with
more consideration. He was about as well fitted for
diplomatic juggleries as a babe in its cradle, and certainly
this beginning was sufficiently unpropitious.</p>

<p>"Flossy, get my hat, that's a dear. Now, Burleigh,
you'll have to let me lean on you. I'm lame still."</p>

<p>The afternoon was enchanting. It was one of those
September days which in some strange way get
transposed into August; when the air is full of hazes
that soften the distant landscape with tints of purple
and smoky blue and topaz; when the breeze is soft
and enervating with a pleasing melancholy, like a
revery, the sweeter for its sadness. The golden-rod
and purple asters seem suddenly to have bloomed by
the roadside, and the trees rustle softly with a dry
murmur as if already falling into "the sear and yellow
leaf." The crickets chirped cheerily in the lichen-covered
stone walls and in the fields, while not a bird
was to be seen or heard, unless now and then some
chatty sparrow gossiping volubly with her neighbor, or
an ill-omened crow that flew heavily over a distant
field.</p>

<p>Burleigh and Patty chose a road leading out of the
village, and lonely as country roads are apt to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Patty was somewhat absent, sadly recalling the conversation
of the previous night; but Burleigh looked
so troubled at her pre-occupation that she resolved to
throw off her heaviness, and began to chat cheerily.</p>

<p>"It is a lovely afternoon to ride," she said. "It is
one of those days when one wants to go somewhere,
yet doesn't know quite where."</p>

<p>"I knew where I wanted to go," he answered,
"and went."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is different with men," she continued,
ignoring the allusion. "You men can always go and
come as you please, and haven't the restrictions to
incite you that we girls have."</p>

<p>"Haven't we? I did not know we were so free.
We usually end, I think, by doing as you like."</p>

<p>"That is an epigram, Burleigh. Since when did
you become so wise?"</p>

<p>"Since you began to knock me about as you chose,"
he answered boldly. "You do as you like with me.
I went to invite you to the picnic, and you had me
take your cousin. This afternoon I went after her,
and have you."</p>

<p>"Did you really!" Patty exclaimed. "Honestly,
I did not think of such a thing. It was all my vanity.
Let's turn round. I didn't mean to cheat Flossy out
of a ride."</p>

<p>"We'll keep on now, I guess," he answered. "I
can take her another time."</p>

<p>"There is no time like the present," Patty said
absently; wondering secretly what was the true nature
of Burleigh's feeling toward her cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't there?" he said, facing her suddenly.
"Then I have a question to ask you. I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"About Flossy?" she interrupted hastily, warned
by the look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"No; about yourself. I"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I want to tell you about Flossy first. You
know she"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk of Flossy," Burleigh said.</p>

<p>Alas! that he would not be warned or hindered. His
excitement swept away every trace of his diffidence,
and he had never looked so manly as now. His somewhat
florid face was pale, and his great eyes looked
straight upon her as if his very soul were in them.</p>

<p>"I love you," he said concisely enough. "I want
you to marry me."</p>

<p>"O Burleigh! Oh, don't! Oh, please!" Patty
cried, drawing away the hand which he had seized to
the neglect of the reins. "I didn't think you could
say such things, when we've always been such good
friends."</p>

<p>"Is that any reason we should not be better
friends?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"But not that way; not"&mdash;</p>

<p>Fate came to her assistance, and spared her the
necessity of completing the sentence. The horse had
been following his own impulses in lack of any direction
from his driver; and bringing the wheel too near
the edge of the ditch, the carriage lightly careened,
depositing its inmates unhurt but badly shaken in the
midst of a sand-heap.</p>

<p>The horse was fortunately well trained; and Burleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had no difficulty in stopping him, which he did
with a very angry face. As for Patty, she sat up in
the sand, and burst into perfect shouts of laughter.
She laughed and laughed, and held her sides and
laughed again until the tears streamed from her eyes.</p>

<p>"O Burleigh!" she cried between her bursts of
merriment. "Oh, I can't help it! Oh, it's too funny!
I shall die, I believe!"</p>

<p>And off she went into fresh peals of laughter, until
her companion felt a strong desire to shake her.</p>

<p>"To think you should tip me over, on top of making
love to me! O Burleigh! it is too awfully droll
for any thing! It is the funniest thing I ever heard
of. Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>"I don't see where the fun comes in," he returned,
rather crossly. "You always laugh at me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't either, but now I can't help it! Don't
look so solemn, or you'll kill me!"</p>

<p>Her escort was hurt and angry. He felt that she
flouted him and his love, and in this he did her injustice.
Chagrin at his rejection, and mortification at the
accident, combined to render him morbidly sensitive.
Besides, he could not know that this lovely girl before
him with flushed cheeks and tumbled hair was laughing
as much from nervousness as from fun, and that
the words of Tom Putnam on the previous night were
as much a motive power in this extravagant cachinnation
as his own proposal.</p>

<p>"I will help you into the buggy," he said stiffly.</p>

<p>"Don't be cross," she said, rising with the aid of
the hand he extended. "I am sorry I vexed you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I was horrid to laugh so. We are good friends again,
and for always, are we not?"</p>

<p>But in that moment of mortification had unconsciously
dawned in the mind of Burleigh Blood the
knowledge, that, however great might be his friendship
for Patty, he did not love her. It is true that it was
some time before he appreciated the discovery; but he
was inclined to be very silent on the homeward way,
although his companion used her utmost endeavors to
restore him to good humor.</p>

<h3>AT REHEARSAL.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Bathalina," Mrs. Sanford said with despair
in her voice, "if you must go, I suppose
you must; but this is the third Wednesday you've
been to that funeral, and I think that's plenty. It isn't
lucky to put off a funeral; and here's all these cucumbers
to pickle, and I can't possibly spare you, but I
suppose I'll have to."</p>

<p>"Cousin Sam's child don't die every day," the
maid retorted; "and of course they couldn't bury her
alive."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!" her mistress assented. "That
would be too awful; but I want you to be sure she is
really dead before you go to her funeral again."</p>

<p>"Yes, she's dead," was the answer. "Peter Mixon
came over last night and told me."</p>

<p>"Peter Mixon had better mind his own business.
You told me yourself, Bathalina, that he was going to
be married this very month to that West girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, mum, of course. But it's a great cross to
him. He asked me first, and if it hadn't been for my
sinful pride I'd a had him in the first place."</p>

<p>"Sinful fire-shovels!" Mrs. Sanford exclaimed.
"You turned him off because he was after the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
you've got in the bank, so don't let me hear any more
about him. If you are going to this protracted funeral,
go along; and I do hope the remains won't
need a great deal more burying. As for Peter Mixon,
the less you have to do with him the better."</p>

<p>"I feel confident," Bathalina answered, "that it's the
last funeral the child'll ever have; but in the midst of
life we are in death."</p>

<p>"You may be," retorted her mistress bustling about;
"but <i>I'm</i> in the midst of pickling, and can't stop to
talk. Go along."</p>

<p>"Mother," Patty asked, appearing in the doorway,
"what is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Bathalina has gone traipsing off to her funeral
again; and here are these cucumbers to do, and the
kitchen all in heaps. She's got fool in the head worse
than ever to-day."</p>

<p>"What awful slang, mother. Never mind, I'll help."</p>

<p>The next visitor to the kitchen was Flossy, who,
having searched the rest of the house for her cousin,
at length discovered her with sleeves rolled up, engaged
in washing dishes.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, Patsy!" she exclaimed. "Are
you here?"</p>

<p>"Mercy sakes, Flossy!" said her aunt. "Don't say
'goodness gracious,' it sounds so."</p>

<p>"No: I'll say 'mercy sakes,' Aunt Britann," her
niece returned saucily. "Patty, what are you washing
dishes for?"</p>

<p>"Somebody must do it; and Bathalina, the insane,
has gone off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are becoming a very model miss. Have you
forgotten they are coming this morning to read this
play?"</p>

<p>"I had forgotten all about that. I'm sorry, marmee,
but I don't see but I must leave you in the lurch.
Here comes somebody now."</p>

<p>The first thing concerning which a country audience
is anxious is that it "gets its money's worth;"
and in amateur theatricals success depends much upon
the duration of the entertainment. Two plays had
therefore been chosen; one a melodramatic affair
entitled, "The Faithful Jewess," and the other a jolly
little comedy called "The Country Wooing." Patty,
who was "the favorite local actress," as Will put it,
had been cast in both plays. Clarence Toxteth was
her Jewish lover, toward a union with whom she struggled
hopefully but vainly through the most heart-rending
situations. A pretended friend,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With falsest heart though fairest seeming,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>endeavored to separate the betrothed, with fatal success.
Mr. Putnam had declined to take part; and the
<i>rôle</i> which had been offered him had been given to
the postmaster, one Sol Shankland.</p>

<p>The company assembled this morning in Mrs. Sanford's
wide, low sitting-room, numbered about a score;
and Babel itself could scarcely have been noisier.
The girls talked of their parts, their dresses, their
hopes and fears, of this, that, and the other, until the
general effect was that of mill-wheels running ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
faster and faster, quite beyond the control of any
regulator.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Will at last. "'I would I
were dead and worms had eaten me, but not for
love.' If there isn't silence here in three seconds, there
will be blood shed!"</p>

<p>By the most energetic measures in the way of
pounding and shouting, something like quiet was obtained,
and the meeting proceeded to business. The
two plays were read, rehearsals appointed, and a great
deal said about the necessity of being letter-perfect
before the next meeting.</p>

<p>"By Monday," Patty said, "we ought to be able to
rehearse without a book."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blackfan is off," Sol Shankland said, "so we
shall have nothing to do Sunday but to study our
parts."</p>

<p>"How immoral!" exclaimed Miss Sturtevant. "I
shall lie in a hammock all day and read."</p>

<p>"I suppose," Will Sanford said, "that I am the
most unfortunate man that ever happened. I sent to
Uncle Christopher for his grandfather's knee-breeches,
and now I can't get into them."</p>

<p>"That is because they are small-clothes," suggested
Ease Apthorpe.</p>

<p>"I think we have some at home," Toxteth said: "if
you will come over, I'll see."</p>

<p>When rehearsal was over, Clarence and Will accordingly
walked off together, accompanying Ease Apthorpe,
who lived in the same direction. Frank Breck
showed some inclination to join the group as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
moved down the walk, but changed his mind, and
accompanied Miss Sturtevant towards Mrs. Brown's.</p>

<p>The Toxteth mansion lay halfway between Dr. Sanford's
and Mullen House, as was somewhat fancifully
called the home of Ease. Will asked Ease to wait
for him, as he was going with her after an extra play-book.
Mrs. Toxteth was sitting upon the veranda, and
invited Ease to a seat by her side while the young men
went into the house.</p>

<p>"It makes me think of old times when theatricals
come up," Mrs. Toxteth said. "I have always
been extravagantly fond of acting and of masquerades."</p>

<p>"I wish we could have a masquerade," remarked
Ease. "We have only had one in three years."</p>

<p>"Why not have one, then?"</p>

<p>"The girls say it is so much trouble to get up
costumes. It is a bother, it is so difficult to get
things."</p>

<p>"But now when you have your costumes all made
for the plays, why not use them? You could arrange
to exchange among yourselves."</p>

<p>"The very thing!" Ease exclaimed. "I am so
glad you thought of it."</p>

<p>"As a reward," Mrs. Toxteth said, "I claim the
privilege of giving the party. But don't speak of it
just yet until I've talked with Clarence."</p>

<p>"Will," Ease asked as they walked towards Mullen
House, "how long does Flossy mean to stay in
Montfield? I am getting so fond of her that I don't
like to think of her going back to Boston."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It may be for years, and it may be forever,'" he
replied. "The case is just this. Flossy's father&mdash;you
know there's nobody left in the family but these
two now&mdash;cares for nothing in the world but his
dinners and whist, as far as I can make out. I don't
know Uncle Christopher very well, but he has the reputation
of giving the best dinners of any man in his
club. He had one once when I was there; and such
a set of red-nosed, blear-eyed, pottle-paunched"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but the old sinners that came
to that dinner were enough to disgust anybody. They
were like the people Paul tells about, each carrying
his own individual god under his waistcoat. No
wonder Flossy doesn't care to stay at home to dine
with those ogres."</p>

<p>"It can't be very nice for her."</p>

<p>"No more is it. She likes to stay here, and we certainly
like to have her. As for her father, if his soup
and his wines are right he is troubled by no concern
for the whereabouts of his friends. So, on the whole,
I dare say she may remain indefinitely."</p>

<p>"Don't you think she and Burleigh Blood are getting
to be very good friends?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed. I thought he was one of Patty's
followers."</p>

<p>"He isn't so much so now," Ease answered. "To-day
at rehearsal he called her Flossy, and then colored
and stammered and begged her pardon. I don't
believe he ever did it before."</p>

<p>She was right; for at that very moment Burleigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Blood was walking along a sweet country road, saying
softly over and over to his bashful but happy self:
"Flossy, Flossy. And she said I was always to call
her so. Flossy: what a pretty name it is too!"</p>

<h2><a name="ChXIV." id="ChXIV.">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>AN ELOPEMENT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> problem of "help" was no less perplexing
in Montfield than in the majority of New-England
villages. Mrs. Sanford often declared that she
had rather do the work for the household than "to
wait upon the hired girl;" but her husband insisted
upon her having a servant, and Bathalina Clemens had
accordingly been engaged. The girl was little better
than half-witted, but she was honest and faithful.
Moreover, Mrs. Sanford could not abide the Irish. So
strong was her dislike for the children of Erin, that had
she known the wish of Thomas Carlyle, that the Emerald
Isle were sunk, she would have indorsed it most
heartily. As it was, she vented her feelings in various
expletives and wishes, which, if less elegant than Carlyle's
Teutonic diction, were certainly more clear and
no less forcible.</p>

<p>"The Irish," Mrs. Sanford was wont to affirm, "are
part pig, or pigs are part Irish, I don't know which.
They tell about pigs living in the house with the Paddies
in Ireland, and I make no doubt that many a pig
has been brought up as a child of the family and nobody
ever the wiser."</p>

<p>So as Mrs. Sanford would have no Irish girl, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
had been obliged to endure Bathalina, who was every
thing her soul abhorred, except that she was neat. It
was her one virtue; and, as people usually do who
have but one virtue, she carried it to excess.</p>

<p>"If she was to get into heaven," her mistress declared,
waxing eloquent, "I know she'd begin to
scour up things, and be down on her knees to wash
the golden streets."</p>

<p>Numberless were the freaks which resulted from
her morbid mania for cleanliness. She would wash
a counterpane if Pettitoes, the most dainty of cats,
happened but to set one of his snowy paws upon it.
She washed her sunshade, her hats, her bonnets, boots,
any thing and every thing. She was accustomed to
prowl about the house, seizing upon any stray article
left in sight, and into the tub it went. Flossy's lace
shawl was rescued on its way to the suds, Patty's muslin
fichu and Will's shooting-jacket were fished out of the
washtub together; and for weeks after the advent of
Miss Clemens the whole house was pervaded with a
damp and discouraging odor, as if in it reigned a perpetual
washing-day.</p>

<p>"This must be stopped," Dr. Sanford declared when
one night on returning home he found the pear-trees
decorated with an old skeleton hoop-skirt, his own
high boots, carefully scoured inside, and a miscellaneous
assortment of smaller wares. Into the kitchen
he walked, and found Bathalina at the washtub chanting
as usual a dismal stave.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tortured in body, and condemned in spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sweet composure, to'"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>"Bathalina," interrupted the master of the house
sternly, "get into that tub."</p>

<p>"What, sir?"</p>

<p>"Get into that tub instantly."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get in."</p>

<p>"But my clothes"&mdash;</p>

<p>"In with you."</p>

<p>"My shoes!"</p>

<p>He picked her up as lightly as if her bony frame
weighed nothing, and deposited her in the midst of
the foamy suds. Her screams quickly brought the
household to the spot.</p>

<p>"Don't you get out," Dr. Sanford said, "until you
have had enough of the washtub to last you for five
years."</p>

<p>"But, Charles," remonstrated his wife, "she'll get
her death cold."</p>

<p>"She's more likely to get her death hot," he returned,
smiling grimly. "Let her soak a while. It
won't hurt her. And now let us have supper."</p>

<p>He marched off to the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Come, Britann; come, Patty."</p>

<p>"But you don't mean to leave that poor creature
there to die, do you?" Mrs. Sanford pleaded. "I
doubt it must be a forerunner of a bad sign to have
such things happen in a house."</p>

<p>The doctor made no reply, but sat down to his
supper quite as if nothing had happened. After the
meal he took his pipe and usual seat on the piazza,
but was hardly seated before Patty appeared, half-choked
with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, father!" she said, "that foolish thing is
in the tub still, and says she won't get out till you tell
her to!"</p>

<p>"Let her stay there then. She will dry quicker
than my boots."</p>

<p>"Soapsuds makes green things grow," put in Will;
"and Bathalina is as green as if she had been browsing
with Nebuchadnezzar."</p>

<p>"Do come, father," Patty said, taking his arm.
"She'll spend the night there if you don't."</p>

<p>Thus urged, Dr. Sanford rose; and the party adjourned
to the kitchen, where the maid-servant still
squatted amid the half-washed clothing like a very
bony mermaid, singing in a defiantly mournful manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Broad is the road that leads to death.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Get out of that tub, Bathalina," Dr. Sanford commanded,
"and stop that noise."</p>

<p>"I'm going home to my Aunt Jeff's," the mermaid
said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense: you'll do nothing of the sort. Get
out of the tub and get dry clothing on."</p>

<p>From that day the servant never washed any thing
save her own person without an express command
from her mistress. Dr. Sanford made her ample
amends for the damage done to her attire; and thereafter
she spoke of him with the utmost respect,
apparently admiring his treatment of her extremely.
She held to him as her ideal of manhood, even after
she had fallen a victim to the wiles of Peter Mixon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
an unscrupulous fellow who had served the Brecks in
the days of their father's magnificence.</p>

<p>"I can't think what has become of Bathalina," Mrs.
Sanford remarked on the evening of the rehearsal.
"She can't have staid at the funeral of that cousin's
child's wife all this time. It's half-past ten."</p>

<p>At that moment the door-bell rang violently.</p>

<p>"Some one has come in considerable haste," grandmother
Sanford said placidly. "Charles, it is probably
some one for thee."</p>

<p>The person ushered into the sitting-room was not
wholly a stranger to the family, and indeed by reputation
they knew her well. She was an aunt of
Bathalina Clemens, and rejoiced in the somewhat
remarkable cognomen of Thomas Jefferson Gooch.
Her grandfather being in his prime an ardent partisan
of that famous statesman, had made a rash vow that
his first grandchild should bear Jefferson's name. The
first-born grandchild proved to be a girl, but the
determined old gentleman, was no more to be restrained
from the fulfilment of his vow than was
Jephtha. Thomas Jefferson was the infant christened,
and as "Aunty Jeff" she was now known to the whole
neighborhood. She was a perfect "roly-poly-pudding"
of a woman, "her husband's sphere," Will
Sanford called her; but her activity was greater than
that of her gauntest neighbor, and she walked as
briskly as if she'd an electric battery in her back hair
to keep her in motion. The corpulent little woman
managed herself and her relatives with a determination
which there was no evading. She dressed always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in rusty black, and went about slipshod, explaining
that she was too fat to reach her feet and lace up boots.</p>

<p>To-day, having been to the funeral of the long death-defying
Emma, her attire was more striking than usual;
her black bonnet being garnished with the largest of
red roses, and a magenta bow lighting up the voluminous
amplitude of her chins, which, like spice-boxes,
came in assorted sizes.</p>

<p>"Good-evenin', Mis' Sanford," Aunty Jeff burst out,
plunging porpoise-like at once into the room and
the midst of her errand. "That ungrateful Bathaliny
Clemens hain't come home, has she? No, of course
she hain't; an' I knew it, the miserable hussy! She's
been elopin' with that all-fired Peter Mixon."</p>

<p>"Eloping!" her listeners cried in chorus.</p>

<p>"Yes, elopin'. I knew there was some kind of a
gum-game up when I seed her an' him comin' in
together. The hussy brought him right into the room
with the mourners, and he looked at the remains as
familiar and easy-like as if he'd been one of the next
relations. I tried to catch Bathaliny's eye, but she
wouldn't look at me. They couldn't walk to the grave
together, 'cause he wasn't called with the mourners.
But when we got there, and Parson Jones was a-prayin',
I peeked through my fingers, and I seed Peter was
a-sneakin' round toward her,&mdash;the dispisable, miser'ble
wretch! An' when we was a-singin' the last
hymn&mdash;we sung,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Why do ye mourn, departed friends?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to the tune of Chany,&mdash;an' I thought the singin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
didn't sound so mournful kinder as it had orter,&mdash;not
nigh so mournful as when we buried Marthy
Foster, she was a Harris, you remember, and second
cousin to Bathaliny on the father's side: so I
looked up to see if Bathaliny was givin' out on the
air; for, bein' a near relation, I naturally felt a care
for the mournin', and wanted to see Emma buried in
decent shape, if she was always a scrawny, pindlin'
little thing, an' her mother Ezikel's first wife. An' I'll
be blowed if that Bathaliny warn't a-sneakin' off
round the thorn-bushes,&mdash;you know where they be,
close by where Frank Wiswell was buried, his mother
bein' a Pettingill,&mdash;she was a-skulkin' off, if you'll
believe it, round them thorn-bushes with Peter Mixup,
or Old Evil One, or whatever he calls himself. I
wanted to holler; but, thinks I to myself, I'm a relation
of the corpse, if it is only by marriage, and I
ain't goin' to spoil the solemnity of this funeral if I
never sets eyes on that scandiculous hussy again!
An' off they went; an' Tim Bowlin see 'em goin' to
Joe Brown's, an' of course they are married long ago,
he bein' a justice. An' I says to myself, 'Mis' Sanford
ought to know, an' I'll go over an' tell her,
bein' as it's one of our family.' It does seem as if her
mother's children was bound to bring disgrace on
themselves and everybody else. Look at Hannah
Clemens! only she ain't to be looked at by an honest
woman. The nasty hussy!"</p>

<p>Aunty Jeff's breath failed entirely at this point; and
she fell back in her chair, her whole person quivering
with excitement and indignation. Dr. Sanford laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
unrestrainedly, and Flossy and Patty were not slow to
follow his lead.</p>

<p>"She's Bathaliny Mixon by this time," aunty Jeff
burst out afresh. "All he wanted of her was the
money she had in the bank. He was bespoke to
'Mandy West too; an' I shouldn't be a mite surprised
ef he got his livin' goin' round marryin' girls just that
way. To think one of our folks should marry a brigamist,"
continued the irate lady, unconsciously punning,
"and demean herself to take up with a Mixon!
He's a dreadful unfacalized critter; an' that's what
I've always said, an' what I'll stick to, ef I was to be
run through the wringin'-machine the next minute, like
that baby's hand over to Samoset&mdash;poor thing! He
never stuck to nothin' 'thout 'twas Mr. Breck, and
them two never got no good out of one 'nother. A
dreadful unfacalized critter! An' I'm in as big a
hurry as a rat in the wall, Mis' Sanford, but thought
you'd want to know, owin' to havin' breakfast to get.
The ungrateful hussy!"</p>

<p>The last objurgation was addressed, not to Mrs. Sanford,
but to the absent Bathalina; that maiden having
evidently defeated the designs of Providence to punish
her sinful pride, and wed Peter Mixon in spite
of his engagement to Amanda West. The following
morning the newly-wed pair came after the possessions
of the bride. Bathalina looked a little sheepish,
and was disposed to apologize for the step she had
taken.</p>

<p>"Being in love," she said to Patty, "I naturally felt
like taking him for better or for worse, especially as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he said his shirts had give out awfully; and he told
no more than the truth, either, as I've see with my
own eyes."</p>

<p>"But where's your wedding-cake, Bathalina?" inquired
Flossy. "A wedding isn't a wedding without
cake."</p>

<p>"It isn't legal without cake," Patty added demurely.</p>

<p>"Ain't it?" demanded Mrs. Mixon, aghast.</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered Flossy. "You are not
married unless you've had wedding-cake, and eaten it
with your friends."</p>

<p>"But we didn't have no time to get cake."</p>

<p>"Then," pronounced Patty, "you are no more
married than I am."</p>

<p>"O Lord! O Lord!" cried the dismayed bride.
"That's what my sinful pride has brought me to. O
Peter, Peter!" she continued, rushing out to the wagon
where he sat waiting: "we ain't married, after all!"</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that Mrs. Sanford, who
appeared at this juncture, persuaded her that her
marriage was legal. Bathalina was not really satisfied
until Patty had produced a loaf of fruit-cake, and
they had all tasted it except Peter, who still sat without,
waiting.</p>

<p>"Now I'm married, at any rate," the bride observed,
"and I don't suppose it makes so much difference to
Peter as it does to me."</p>

<p>A slice of cake was at this hint sent to the bridegroom;
and the Mixons drove away, leaving Mrs.
Sanford face to face with the tremendous task of finding
another servant.</p>

<h3>A CASTLE IN THE AIR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Grandmother Sanford's</span> pension had
come to be a standing joke. The charming old
lady had begun to found upon her expectations the
most extensive schemes for benevolence; which, as
the pension, if obtained, would be only eight dollars a
month, seemed rather premature.</p>

<p>"Charles," she said, "I wish thee'd advance me a
small sum on the security of my pension. I desire to
send some wine to old Mrs. Utley, and I do not wish
to draw for it."</p>

<p>"That pension will be the ruin of you, mother," he
said, laughing, as he gave her the money. "You've
spent it two or three times over now."</p>

<p>"Thee is mistaken, son," she returned. "There
are arrears due, besides that for the future. If friend
Putnam would hasten a little, and arrange matters, it
would be pleasant."</p>

<p>Mr. Putnam with his nephews had planned a fishing
expedition, meaning to leave home Saturday morning,
and camp in the woods a few days.</p>

<p>Will Sanford remarked at the breakfast-table Sunday
morning, that they did not get away before noon; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
some comment was made about their starting so near
Sunday.</p>

<p>"They must be back so soon for rehearsals," Patty
remarked. "Hazard said they wanted all the time
they could get."</p>

<p>"It is a splendid day," Will continued. "I wish
I were with them! There's no meeting to-day, and I
think I'll drive over to Samoset to church this afternoon.
Want to go, girls?"</p>

<p>"I'll go," answered Flossy. "I want to see what
they wear over there."</p>

<p>Her cousin, however, preferred remaining at home,
and about the middle of the afternoon might have
been seen sauntering leisurely down the garden-path,
book in hand, toward the old-fashioned summerhouse.</p>

<p>As has been said, the Putnam place adjoined that of
Dr. Sanford. A brook flowed between, crossed by a
rustic bridge, and fringed with a tangled thicket of
elder, roses, wild clevis, and ground-nut vines, with
here and there a tall clump of alders wading knee-deep
into the water. Not far from the bridge, in the
field behind the Putnam mansion, stood a monster elm
in the branches of which Mr. Putnam had had an
arbor constructed by the placing of a flooring upon
two nearly horizontal branches, and surrounding this
with a railing. The arbor was reached by means of
ladders, and was so completely hidden by the boughs
as to be invisible from below.</p>

<p>The wild asters blooming by the brook attracted
Patty's steps; and she stood for some moments leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
upon the railing of the bridge, looking down into the
water, or out over the lovely scene about her.</p>

<p>It was one of those soft days of early September
which are like a memory or a dream. The sky was
cloudless, the grass and foliage yet untouched by frost,
but beginning to show russet tints of ripeness. The
only sound which came to the maiden's ears was the
soft purling of the brook beneath her feet as it flowed
among the sedges and alders. Now and then a
dragon-fly flitted like a flash across; and occasionally
a minnow, with the gleam of a dark back or red-tipped
fin, darted through the dusky water.</p>

<p>Patty was out of sympathy with the peaceful scene.
Such a restless mood had seized her as she seldom
experienced. She was dissatisfied with every thing,
most of all with Tom Putnam. Since the night of the
thunder-storm, she had scarcely seen her lover. The
day following he had called while she was riding with
Burleigh Blood. The next day he had seen her, indeed,
but in a room full of people. For a moment
they were alone together one morning soon after, but
the interview had been unsatisfactory. Women demand
from the men they love their utmost. A man
having in some passionate moment shown his capability
for utter devotion, his lady feels a vague terror
when he falls below this high-wrought mood, as he
inevitably must. Perhaps it is the hereditary instinct
of a sex that has found men too apt to reach a crisis
of passion, only to fall away from it fatally and forever.
It is difficult for women to understand a love which
flows silently in an underground channel. The lawyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had been too much like his ordinary self, and too little
like the ardent lover who had kissed Patty's hand so
hotly that August night. He seemed to assume in
addressing her that they were betrothed, and she
resented this as presumption.</p>

<p>"I am not engaged to you," she said pettishly.
"Goodness knows where you got that idea!"</p>

<p>"I dreamed it," he returned; "and the dream was
so pleasant, that I chose to believe it."</p>

<p>"It could only have been a nightmare," she retorted.</p>

<p>Immediately after, he had been called from home on
business, returning only in time to make arrangements
for the fishing expedition; and, as Patty was out when
he called, she had not seen him since his return.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" sighed Patty, lifting her eyes from
the water to glance toward the Putnam house half-buried
in trees. "Heigh-ho! I am getting as stupid
as an owl. Now that good fortune has come, I suppose
Tom will repair the house. How aunt Pamela
will cackle over it! She is always sighing over the
departed grandeur of the place."</p>

<p>Aunt Pamela Gilfether was the widowed sister of
Tom Putnam's father. She moaned over the fallen
fortunes of her race as the autumn wind wails over the
departed summer. Her great desire had been that
her nephew should marry, and build up the family; and
the worthy lady had a standing grievance against Miss
Sturtevant for presuming to attempt to insnare Tom
by her fascinations. Whenever Miss Sturtevant was
mentioned, aunt Pamela was wont to remark contemptuously
upon her "blue chany eyes," by which she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
understood to indicate that Flora had eyes like those
of a china doll.</p>

<p>At the moment Patty's thoughts recurred to aunt
Pamela, that lady was seated upon the piazza, talking
with Hazard Breck.</p>

<p>"I know he'd have asked Patty long ago," Mrs.
Gilfether said, "if only he'd been easy in his affairs.
Your father was no kind of a provider, nor no kind of
a getting-ahead man, as you know. And what with
having you boys on his hands, and me too,&mdash;though,
to be sure, I'm a Putnam,&mdash;it's been a hard pull on
Tom."</p>

<p>"I know it, aunt Pamela," Hazard answered in a
low tone.</p>

<p>The pain he felt at discovering his uncle's fondness
for Patty made him oblivious to the little stings with
which aunt Pamela was accustomed to give piquancy
to her conversation.</p>

<p>"There he is, up there in that tree now," the lady
went on pathetically, "and moping and mooning for
that girl, I've no manner of doubt. Not that he ever
said a word, or that she's half good enough for him;
but he's been crazy over her this ten years, and nothing
was just exactly right but what Patience Sanford
did."</p>

<p>The idea of his uncle's "moping and mooning"
from any cause struck Hazard as ludicrous enough;
and he smiled, even while his young heart was full of
pain. He rose, and went into the house for his hat,
setting out immediately after for a walk.</p>

<p>Whether there was any unconscious influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mind of aunt Pamela upon the consciousness of
Patty, standing on the bridge, is a question psychologists
may consider, if they please. Certain it is, that,
while Mrs. Gilfether was commenting upon the love
of her nephew for the doctor's daughter, the glance
of the maiden was arrested by the ladders leading to
Mr. Putnam's Castle in the Air, as he called his elm-tree-arbor;
and her thoughts flew in that direction.</p>

<p>"I've a mind to go up there," she said to herself.
"The men are all away, and it must be jolly."</p>

<p>She looked about her in all directions, but discerned
no one. She hesitated a moment, then crossed the
Rubicon by running lightly and rapidly across the field,
and began to mount the ladders. At the top of the
first ladder she looked about her again, but still discovered
no one. She had been a bit of a romp in her
younger days, and a feeling of tom-boyish joy came
over her. Nimbly as a squirrel she ran up the second
ladder. The third was very short, and shut about
closely with leaves and branches. As she put her
foot upon the lowest rung, the odor of a cigar greeted
her nostrils.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon," said the voice of Tom Putnam
above her.</p>

<p>Her short-lived joy vanished in the twinkling of an
eye.</p>

<p>"What right has he there?" was her first thought.
"I will <i>not</i> go back!" was her second. She stepped
up the ladder, disregarding the proffered hand of her
lover, and stood upon the floor of the arbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Welcome to the Castle in the Air," he said, extending
his hand once more.</p>

<p>She took it with a pout.</p>

<p>"I thought you had gone fishing," said she petulantly.</p>

<p>"We started," he answered; "but we broke down
between here and Samoset, so we gave it up."</p>

<p>Patty looked about her curiously. The arbor was
half a dozen feet across, with wall and ceiling of green
boughs. It was a grotto dug in a huge emerald. On
one side an opening had been cut in the foliage, so as
to afford a view of the river, and the mountains beyond,
now blue and purple with autumn hazes. The castle
was securely railed in, and furnished with three or
four rustic seats, besides a small table, or rather shelf,
supported by a living bough. Upon this lay an open
book, in which the lawyer had apparently been reading.</p>

<p>"I trust my cigar does not trouble you," he said:
"I'll drop it if it does."</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>Magnetism by induction is a phenomenon no less
interesting in the intellectual than in the physical
world. The restless mood of Patty, her defensive
attitude, began to re-act upon her companion. She
unconsciously was defending herself from herself, rather
than from him; while he was at once puzzled and
offended by her repellence. Patty was more affected
by this meeting with her lover than she realized, and
her nature instinctively guarded itself against any betrayal
of emotion. She affected, as many another has
done, to cover her concern by a mask of indifference,
and began to banter gayly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would on no account have come here, had I
known you were at home," she said.</p>

<p>"Um,"&mdash;he returned. "You and truth have one
thing in common."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it. What may that be?"</p>

<p>"You are both very coy when sought, and yet will
often show your faces unasked."</p>

<p>"Thanks! That is, then, our only resemblance?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! You both can say extremely disagreeable
things."</p>

<p>"And both are very unpleasant generally, I suppose
you'd like to add."</p>

<p>"By no means. That would be impolite to my
guest."</p>

<p>"I am glad if you keep a semblance even of good
manners."</p>

<p>"Manners?" he said reflectively. "I dimly remember
having had something of the kind in my youth,
but I long since threw them aside. I thought them
out of fashion."</p>

<p>"Is that the reason you have not asked me to sit
down?"</p>

<p>"I did not know as you would stay long enough to
make it an object."</p>

<p>"I can go, of course, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"Don't on my account, I beg," he said coolly. "I
am charmed to have you here. I should have invited
you, had I supposed you'd accept."</p>

<p>"You have, hundreds of times."</p>

<p>"Have I? We say so many of those things for
politeness' sake, and forget them instantly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>She tossed her head, and took up the book he had
been reading.</p>

<p>"'Thomas Putnam,'" she read upon the fly-leaf.
"What an extremely homely name!" she commented.</p>

<p>"A matter of taste," he replied. "I confess that
Patience Putnam would please me better."</p>

<p>"You are very rude!" she said, angry that she needs
must blush.</p>

<p>"Am I? You may have an opportunity to polish
my manners whenever you choose."</p>

<p>"They need it badly enough; but some materials
are so coarse-grained, that they will take no polish.
Will you please talk sensibly for a few moments?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Any thing to please you. Your request
is at once too reasonable and too polite to be disregarded.
Have you any choice of subject?"</p>

<p>"What have you been reading?"</p>

<p>"Merely a foolish lovelorn ditty."</p>

<p>"Read it to me," she commanded.</p>

<p>"As you please; if you will give me the book.
Sir John Suckling is responsible for it."</p>

<p>"'Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings,'"
Patty quoted.</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled, and in his rich voice read the
following poem:&mdash;</p>

<p>He read better than he intended, or, indeed, than
he knew. His voice had always a remarkable power
over Patty,&mdash;a fascination which she loved to experience.
As he read, she turned away from him, and
gazed through the twig-set window toward the softly-outlined
hills. As he concluded, she turned her face
toward him like a flash of light.</p>

<p>"Do you believe it?" she asked in a voice which
proved her melted mood.</p>

<p>But her companion was less facile in his mental
changes, and did not respond to this quick transition
from banter to sentiment.</p>

<p>"I believe," he replied, "that it is wholly and
entirely&mdash;poetry. It is not a bad description of Burleigh
Blood."</p>

<p>She sprang up impetuously from the seat into
which she had sunk, and began to pace restlessly up
and down.</p>

<p>"But there is some snap to that sort of love," she
said: "one can believe in its earnestness."</p>

<p>"And in its unreasoning exaction," he returned.
"It must be very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"But I'd rather be hated than comfortably loved:
it would amount to more. I hate placidity. I think
love should be so strong that one surrenders one's
whole being to it."</p>

<p>"You are like the rest of your sex," he began. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
at that moment a paper fluttered out of the book whose
leaves he had been turning carelessly as they talked.
"Very <i>apropos</i>," he said, taking it up. "This is the
work of a college-friend of mine. I trust you'll pardon
my reading it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is simply abominable!" Patty exclaimed.
"He had no idea what love is!"</p>

<p>"I understand that to imply that you do," Mr.
Putnam said critically.</p>

<p>"Women know that by intuition."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Every woman desires the sort of love Suckling
describes," she said insistently, standing at the window,
with her back toward her companion.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "Taste in love is
as different as taste in flavors."</p>

<p>"But every one must desire true love."</p>

<p>"True love is no more palatable to all than is
honey."</p>

<p>She turned suddenly, and faced him. He was
startled to see how pale she was.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried, springing up from his
lounging position. "Are you dizzy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said.</p>

<p>He made her sit down, and began to fan her with
his hat. Every look and motion was full of solicitude,
but the girl shrank from him.</p>

<p>"It is nothing. It has passed now," she said; by a
strong effort recovering her composure.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," he began; but she interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"It is all passed," she said, laughing nervously.
"I am very foolish. What do you think of the
weather?"</p>

<p>"The moon last night entertained a select circle
with one or two stars in it," he said slowly, while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
watched her with keen eyes; "and that seems to
promise rain."</p>

<p>"That is unfortunate," she answered, rising. "We
have rehearsal in the afternoon at Selina Brown's, and
it is so uncomfortable getting about in the rain!"</p>

<p>"You are not going home now?"</p>

<p>"I must. I am deeply grateful to you for your
hospitality, and more for your frankness."</p>

<p>"My frankness?"</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>"Wait. You will be dizzy on the ladders."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I never was dizzy in my life."</p>

<p>"Not a moment ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! But I am clear-headed now. Don't
come. I really mean it. I don't want you."</p>

<p>She slipped down the ladder, leaving him alone.
He stood a moment looking at the branches which
hid her from his sight, and then flung himself down
upon a rustic seat in deep thought.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Patty went back towards the brook and
her home. She stopped at the bridge as before, but
now the vague unrest in her heart was changed to
positive pain. It had not been giddiness which had
made her white, but a sudden conviction, that, after
all, her lover had no passion worth the name. She
was very unhappy,&mdash;so unhappy, indeed, as to forget
to be angry with herself for being so. She saw
Hazard Breck coming down the brookside, and looked
about for a means of escape from meeting him. At
that moment he looked up, and saw her. He involuntarily
made a motion, as if half minded to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
back; and instantly a desire arose in Patty to encounter
him. Life, like dreams, goes often by contraries;
and desires are oftener caught upon the rebound
than directly.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon," Patty called, with a fine assumption
of gayety.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon," he answered, coming up to
her side, and leaning upon the railing of the bridge.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of suicide?" she asked, as he
continued to look, not at her, but intently into the
water.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Then don't look so melancholy, please."</p>

<p>"How shall I look?"</p>

<p>"I don't much care; only don't have that dreadful
dead-and-gone expression."</p>

<p>"Shall I grin?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!"</p>

<p>"Why may I not look melancholy, then?"</p>

<p>"Because it does not please me to have you," she
said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he retorted. "The trouble is not in me,
then, but in your mood."</p>

<p>"I am not given to moods. I am <i>semper idem</i>."</p>

<p>"So is a post."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" Patty replied. "You are as complimentary
as your uncle."</p>

<p>"Uncle Tom? Where did you see him?"</p>

<p>"At various places in Montfield all my life."</p>

<p>Hazard began to look at her curiously. He had
at first noticed nothing strange in her manner, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
too much occupied with his own disquietude, having
left the house after aunt Pamela had confided to him
his uncle's passion. He had been walking along the
side of the brook, recalling the thousand signs of this
love which he had seen, and yet accounted not at
all; and he wondered, man-like, at his own obtuseness
to what now seemed so clear. When he met
Patty, he was absorbed in counterfeiting indifference;
but something in her tone made him perceive at
length that she was not her usual self. Perhaps the
love in his own heart, whose fruition he had unquestioningly
resigned at the words of aunt Pamela, made
him clearer sighted. He longed to question her, to
tell her of his uncle's love and of his own. His lip
trembled with the impetuous words he could not
speak, and his eyes were fixed upon her face with an
intense gaze which was more than she could bear.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said hastily, and went her way.</p>

<p>"Don't fail to be at rehearsal," she called, lest he
should think her leave-taking abrupt.</p>

<p>But she would not look back, for her eyes were full
of tears.</p>

<p>Hazard walked thoughtfully on towards the house,
which he reached just as a woman drove to the front
entrance. It was the woman who went under the
name of Mrs. Smithers, and she had driven over from
Samoset after Mr. Putnam.</p>

<h3>THE CHURCH AT SAMOSET.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> road to Samoset was up hill and down hill,
and altogether uneven; but it lay through a
lovely country, just now colored with those soft hues
autumn wears before her gorgeous gala dress is ready.
Beside the way the squirrels leaped and chattered in
the Sunday stillness as our friends drove to church.
Flossy had proposed that they call for Ease Apthorpe;
and her cousin, who had been secretly wishing her to
make this suggestion, assented with alacrity. Ease
yielded to the temptation of a ride on so beautiful an
afternoon, and abandoned her own for the Unitarian
service at Samoset. In spite of Mrs. Sanford's reflections
upon the narrowness of modern buggies, the
seat of their carriage proved wide enough for the
three, perhaps because Ease, like Flossy, was rather
small.</p>

<p>Halfway between Montfield and Samoset the
country-road crossed a large brook, which was known
as Wilk's Run. It was deep and swift, being fed by
springs among the hills; and it foamed along its
channel, fretting at every bowlder, with a sense of its
own importance, little more reasonable than if it had
been gifted with human intelligence. The banks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the stream were rough, and broken with miniature
coves and shallows, cliffs and caves, where the schoolchildren,
picnicking or playing truant, frolicked joyously.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Will," Ease said, as our friends
halted upon the bridge to look up and down the
Run, "do you remember the May Day when we hid
Sol Shankland's pea-shooter in the hole in the rock?"</p>

<p>"I think I do," he returned, laughing. "He pelted
Selina Brown until she threatened to drown herself;
and Emily Purdy inquired if we supposed Mrs. Brown
would get to the funeral in time to be called with the
mourners."</p>

<p>"I wonder if the thing is there now," continued
Ease. "That was&mdash;why, it was seven years ago:
think of it!"</p>

<p>"We might see," Will suggested. "We are early
enough."</p>

<p>"It would be such fun!"</p>

<p>"You don't mind staying with the horse, do you,
Floss?" Will asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I shall drive on if I do. I know the
road to Samoset perfectly."</p>

<p>"Come on, then, Ease: we'll investigate."</p>

<p>Off the pair went, laughing and chatting like two
children. Flossy waited until they had clambered
down the rocky path to the water below the bridge,
and then shouted to them.</p>

<p>"What is it?" her cousin asked.</p>

<p>"I'll call when I come from church," she screamed
in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she deliberately drove off.</p>

<p>"By George!" Will exclaimed. "That's just like
Floss: I might have known."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked his companion in
dismay.</p>

<p>"Do? Make ourselves comfortable. Meeting
won't be more than an hour, and we can endure that.
It is a great deal pleasanter here than in church."</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented doubtfully.</p>

<p>"And, as we can't help ourselves, it is no use to
fret."</p>

<p>They found a cosey nook, and a log for a seat, which
Will, with a praiseworthy care for Ease's Sunday raiment,
covered with a newspaper he chanced to have
in his pocket. They fell to chatting of old times, the
theatricals, Will's college-scrapes, and the thousand
things which give to life its varied savors. Will in a
quiet fashion had been fond of his companion from
childhood, but had never thought it necessary to tell
her so: indeed, he had never in any serious way
considered the fact himself, but, being fond of her
companionship, had sought and accepted it as a matter
of course. This placid afternoon, with the water at
their feet, the trees rustling in the faintest whispers overhead,
and the air about them mellow and fragrant, a
sensuous, "lotus-fed content" stole over them, and
the moments went by unheeded. They were too
much at ease for lovers, but they were the best of
friends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Flossy Plant, filled with a wicked glee,
drove onward to Samoset, found an old man to fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
her horse, and walked into church as demurely as the
most saintly maiden of them all. The party had set
out for the Unitarian church; but Flossy, having taken
matters into her own hands, drove to quite another
sanctuary. She had often heard her cousins laugh
about the quaintness of a church of Scotch Presbyterians
which had been established in the earlier days of
Samoset, and which still retained much of its antique
simplicity.</p>

<p>She had seen the building in driving with Will, and
now the whim had seized her to attend the service.
She was a little late, and an icy breath of stern theology
seemed to meet her when she entered. She
slipped into a seat near the door, and half held her
breath, lest a precentor should start up from some
unsuspected corner, and pounce upon her for disturbing
the awful solemnity of the assembly.</p>

<p>The building was plain to ugliness,&mdash;a square box,
high and bare, with stiff pews, whose uncushioned
angles precluded the possibility of any sacred drowsiness.
The windows were devoid of shutters, the floor
was carpetless, the pulpit as guiltless of cushions as
the pews. The congregation had a blue, pinched
look, as if their religion were too difficult of digestion
to be nourishing, and a moral dyspepsia had been the
result of swallowing large portions of it.</p>

<p>The preacher, however, was a noble-looking man,
with snowy hair and beard. He was reading and
expounding the twenty-second Psalm when Flossy
entered; and she could not but be struck with the
force of his unaffected diction and the nobility of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
thought, colored though it necessarily was by his
narrow theology.</p>

<p>But all solemn meditations were suddenly interrupted,
when, the exposition ended, the congregation
sang the psalm which had been read. No wicked
hymns, the invention of men, are allowed in the conservative
precincts of orthodox Presbyterianism, but
only the old metrical versions of the Psalms of David.
The old custom of having the precentor sit in a box
before the pulpit was not followed in the church at
Samoset, nor were the lines deaconed out; these two
concessions having been grudgingly made to the progressive
spirit of the age. The precentor sat in the
front pew; and, suddenly stepping out before the people,
he began in a cracked, nasal tenor to sing the
psalm read. The congregation generously allowed
him half a line the start, and then one after the other
attempted the hopeless task of overtaking him before
he completed the stanza. He had a great advantage
from the fact that he probably knew what tune he
intended to sing; and by skilfully introducing sundry
original quavers, runs, and quirks, he succeeded in
throwing his pursuers so completely off the scent, that,
although at least a dozen different airs were tried by
various members of the chorus, no one seemed really
to have hit the right one until the precentor had
triumphantly completed two stanzas, and got well
into the third.</p>

<p>The effect was indescribable. Flossy was at first too
amazed to understand what was the matter; and then
it required all her energies to keep from laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
aloud. How any human beings could stand up and
give vent to such unearthly sounds, and still preserve
their gravity, was beyond her comprehension. The
volume of noise constantly increased as one after
another of the singers, having tried hastily half a dozen
or more tunes in various keys, came proudly into the
right one, pouring forth a torrent of sound to let the
precentor know, that, after all, he was conquered, and
his secret wrested from him. That individual, finding
himself defeated in his endeavors to conceal the tune
under new and more elaborate variations, sulkily abandoned
the contest, and tried to sing it correctly, thereby
coming so far from the original, that once more the
congregation were puzzled, and, concluding him to
have changed the air, struck anew into a wild variety
of experiments more discordant than before.</p>

<p>The singing was so astonishing, that the words did
not at first impress Flossy; but they were sufficiently
remarkable when once her attention was fixed on them.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like water I'm poured out, my bones<br /></span>
<span class="i2">all out of joynt do part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst my bowels, as the wax,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">so melted is my heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My strength is like a pot-sheard dry'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">my tongue it cleaveth fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto my jaws; and to the dust<br /></span>
<span class="i2">of death thou brought me hast."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so on through innumerable stanzas.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the service Flossy gave her
attention chiefly to the book of psalms, and very entertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
she found it. She had a very funny time all
alone in the corner of the great bare pew, her golden
hair fluffed about her face, and her cheeks flushed with
her efforts to restrain her laughter. She grew more
and more absorbed until at the lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like as the hart for water-brooks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">in thirst doth pant and bray,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she forgot herself entirely, and a little golden trill of
laughter rippled through the solemn old church. Then
poor Flossy felt, rather than saw, the looks of horror
and indignation which were cast in her direction, and
her cheeks burned like fire. She relieved her mind by
pulling to pieces a ragged psalmody; and, as she grew
calmer, the printed paper used in the binding caught
her eye. Upon it she read the following notice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dec. 25, by the Rev. Edward French, William Sanford of
Montfield, to Linda, youngest daughter of Ezekiel Thaxter,
Esq."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Grandmother Sanford's wedding," Flossy said to
herself, and dreamed over the notice until the service
ended.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she remarked to the horse, looking at her
watch as she drove out of Samoset: "how late it is!
Do get along faster. What will Ease and Will think
has become of me? Get up! Mercy, who's that?"</p>

<p>It was the stalwart form of Burleigh Blood she saw,
walking along the grassy edge of the road. He turned
his head as she approached, lifting his hat, and blushing
diffidently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said, drawing rein beside
him. "Will you ride?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered confusedly, "I&mdash;I
think not."</p>

<p>"Very well," she returned, "get in then."</p>

<p>He laughed and obeyed her, as if he had given the
acceptance her words assumed.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" Flossy asked as they
drove on. "How in the world do you happen to be
straying about so on Sunday? Have you been to
church?"</p>

<p>"Yes: I rode over this morning, and staid all day."</p>

<p>"But you didn't eat your horse for dinner, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I had dinner at aunt Phelena's. I lent
the horse. Joe Brown and his wife came over to see
their cousin. Her husband has disappeared, and
nobody knows what has become of him."</p>

<p>"Disappeared?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He went out to his office, and never came
back."</p>

<p>"How disgusting for a man to act so!" exclaimed
Flossy. "Why, the friends can't tell whether to have
a funeral, or be chirky. It must be dreadfully aggravating.
It keeps them all at home, and yet they don't
know what to expect."</p>

<p>"It is usually safe to expect the worst."</p>

<p>"But that isn't pleasant. One doesn't like to be in
the dumps without being obliged to be. And it's not
only the immediate family, but other folks,&mdash;sort of
cousins, and the like. I should be awfully cross if I
were a cousin. They can't even have the comfort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the services, or of wearing black, no matter how becoming
it is to them. For my part, I think it would be a
great deal less selfish to leave word whether there's
a funeral or not."</p>

<p>"I don't think people who disappear can always
help it," he said, laughing. "But I suppose you'll
leave a note saying, 'Farewell&mdash;farewell forever;' or
something like that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll say 'Funeral at such a time, and I'll be
ready.' How shockingly I talk! So saying, she
folded her lips, and sank into silence. Will you
drive, please?"</p>

<p>"This cousin of the Browns," Burleigh remarked,
"just went off, or was carried off, or something else:
at least, he is gone. The Browns were going home in
the mail-team at nine o'clock this morning, but Mrs.
Brown didn't get ready until about one this afternoon."</p>

<p>"And you lent them your horse. That was very
good of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! It was only casting bread upon the waters.
I shall want a good turn of him some time, likely
enough."</p>

<p>"I never supposed," Flossy returned critically, "that
bread cast upon the waters could be worth much when
it came back after many days. It most likely would be
mouldy, and so water-soaked it wouldn't be fit to eat."</p>

<p>"I don't like to joke about Scripture," he said
gravely, flushing at his own boldness. "Of course,"
he added, "I don't think you meant any harm."</p>

<p>"Of course not. It is a trick I have caught from
father: it is part of my inheritance, like dyspepsia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and a liver. Though why," she added, "it should
be called a liver, I can't see. I think <i>dier</i> would be
more appropriate."</p>

<p>At that moment Wilk's Run came in sight.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Flossy exclaimed. "I entirely forgot
them, but this man put them all out of my head."</p>

<p>Her companion answered only by a puzzled stare.</p>

<p>"This one that disappeared, you know," she explained
lucidly. "And they went to find a popgun,
or something, and the service was so very long, you
know."</p>

<p>Burleigh, vainly endeavoring to catch some clew to
her meaning, said nothing. In another moment they
reached the bridge. No person was to be seen.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd shout," Flossy said. "They can't
be far off."</p>

<p>"What shall I shout?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you know a word I've been saying,"
she remarked, looking into his face. "I want you to
call them."</p>

<p>Burleigh was not without a sense of humor, and his
bashfulness had yielded in a great degree to the
pleasure which Miss Plant's presence gave him. He
accepted the command literally, and roared, "Them!
them!" so lustily that the rocky banks of the brook
re-echoed.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" cried his companion. "You've lungs
like organ-bellows. I'll get out and look for them
before I'm stone-deaf."</p>

<p>"If 'them' means Will and Ease Apthorpe," Burleigh
said, "there they come now."</p>

<h2><a name="ChXVII." id="ChXVII.">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<h3>A CONFIDENCE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shores of Wilk's Run were as varied as the
caprices of a coquette. Here the rocks rose
up bold and steep, with broken faces over which
trailed green and graceful ferns, and in whose clefts
and niches bloomed in spring clusters of the pale-red
columbines. Again the groves of birch and poplar,
or the copses of walnut-trees, grew quite down to the
water's edge, their golden or silver trunks gleaming
out of the half-luminous dusk of their leaves. Occasionally
a tiny meadow would be planted upon the
brook's bank, fringed with rushes and moisture-loving
plants; while at another spot the turf, level and verdant,
formed a greensward fit for the foot of a princess
or a fairy. It was to a nook shut in by a wall of
rocks, and carpeted with the softest grass, that Will
and Ease came after rambling about for a time. A
large golden birch stood near the middle of the open
space, its leaves forever quivering, aspen-like, and
mingling their murmur with the ripple of the brook,
until only the "talking-bird" seemed needed to complete
the trio of the garden of the Princess Parizade.
Knots of golden-rod, and the purple tassels of the
asters, fringed the foot of the rocky wall half enclosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the place; and there, too, the nightshade trailed its
rich clusters of claret-hued berries. The leaves of the
woodbine, which had climbed up the rocks on one side,
contesting every foothold with a wild grape-vine now
hanging heavy with purple clusters, had begun to turn
crimson with ripeness, and furnished a mass of high
color.</p>

<p>The schoolgirls of Montfield, like schoolgirls in
general, more sentimental than original, had named
this place "Lovers' Retreat;" not, indeed, that tradition
or history recorded that any lovers ever did, might,
could, would, or should retreat thither, but because
the spot and the name had both a gentle fascination
for their maiden bosoms.</p>

<p>The popgun for which Will and Ease came to look
was not to be found, having, doubtless, long since
mouldered into dust. The search for it, however,
called up a thousand reminiscences, over which they
chatted and laughed like children.</p>

<p>"This is a vast deal better than going to church,"
Will said, stretching himself comfortably at the feet of
his companion, who sat leaning against the trunk of the
birch-tree. "I am glad Floss left us. What a queer
little thing she is!"</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time we went nutting," said
Ease, "and Emily Purdy ran away with the horse,
so that we had to walk home?"</p>

<p>"I guess I do! That was the time you turned your
ankle, and your aunt Tabitha accused me of having
lamed you for life."</p>

<p>"Yes. And Mrs. Brown got along with her infallible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
lotion the day after I first walked out. She was so
astonished when she met me!"</p>

<p>"That's precisely the way she did when Sol Shankland
was hit in the eye with 'old Thunderbust.' You
remember the ball we called 'old Thunderbust,' don't
you?"</p>

<p>Very good companions had these two always been,
but without a thought of love between them. They
were too frank, too calmly happy together, for love.
The old days, the old memories, cast a soft glow over
all their relations with each other,&mdash;a light not love,
but the rosy hues of a dawn that was yet to be, the
luminous foretelling of the sun of passion before the
day. They often alluded lightly to the persons they
meant to marry,&mdash;ideals which unconsciously they
made somehow like each other, even when intended
most to be different.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," Will remarked this afternoon, in
a dispassionate tone, "that Frank Breck goes to see
you often enough."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he! I wish he wouldn't. Were ever
two brothers more unlike than he and Hazard?"</p>

<p>"They are different. Hazard is a royal fellow, but
the less said of Frank the better."</p>

<p>"Yes: only"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>The temptation of an appreciative listener has
elicited many a secret which sharpest tortures could
not have wrung from its possessor. Ease had no
intention of disclosing to her friend the troubles
which buzzed gnat-like about her ears at home; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the time, the place, and, more than all, his interested
face and his often-proved sympathy won the tale
from her.</p>

<p>"It all came about," she said, "before I understood
any thing of it; and now I don't know the
whole story. There is something about a will that
I've no clew to."</p>

<p>"Really, this is an impressive beginning," Sanford
said. "You don't mind if I smoke?"</p>

<p>"No. I noticed that aunt Tabitha acted queerly
when Frank Breck's name was mentioned, or rather I
remember it now; but it has always seemed as if
every thing that happened at Mullen House was
strange some way. I've always seemed to be somebody
else, and not myself, ever since I came here to
live."</p>

<p>"It is strange," Will assented. "It is a sort of
ogre's castle, and your aunt, 'savin' yer presince,' is
the ogress."</p>

<p>"Aunt Tabitha has always been a puzzle to me,"
Ease said, "and I never attempt to understand her
ways."</p>

<p>"Who does?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Frank kept coming and coming," continued she,
"and getting more and more bothersome, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"More what?"</p>

<p>"Bothersome, acting foolish, you know, about me,
as if he were&mdash;well you understand, of course,
what I mean. I don't think I'm vain; but he did
act as if he was&mdash;why, as if he liked me."</p>

<p>"Made love to you, you mean?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes: I suppose so."</p>

<p>"The puppy!"</p>

<p>"Why, that wasn't any harm, was it?" she asked
naïvely. "Only, of course, I hate to have him about
all the time, and I never liked him very well."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," the young man interpolated
with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Not that he ever troubled me much, for of
course I didn't let him; but he wanted to."</p>

<p>"Look here," Will exclaimed, sitting up. "I've
always been like a brother to you, Ease, and now you
are in a place where you need a brother more than
ever. I think I'd better hint gently to that young
donkey that he'd find it safer to let you alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" she replied. "You mustn't let
anybody know that you know this. Aunt Tabitha
told me not to say a word to anybody, and particularly
to you. I'm not sure I didn't promise not to
tell, but I must talk to somebody. There is something
or other they don't tell me about a will; and
aunt Tabitha says we shall both be paupers, if I don't
do as she wishes."</p>

<p>"Do as she wishes? What does she want you to
do?"</p>

<p>"She has promised him that I shall marry him,"
Ease said earnestly, with cheeks like the petals of a
damask rose.</p>

<p>"The devil she has!"</p>

<p>"Hush! You mustn't talk so. Of course she
wouldn't make me; but, if she did, what could I
do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do!" he exclaimed hotly. Then suddenly he
changed his tone to one of cool impartiality. "If
she makes you marry him, of course you'll have to
do it."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't like to be made to marry him,"
she said, half crying.</p>

<p>"No," he replied with an air of great candor. "I
don't fancy I should. Frank Breck," he added vehemently,
"is his father over again. I wonder if Putnam
knows what he's about."</p>

<p>"Oh, he couldn't!" Ease returned. "I don't
understand it myself; only you mustn't let any one
know I've told you any thing."</p>

<p>"Look here, Ease," her companion said, flinging
his cigar halfway across Wilk's Run, and taking her
hand in his. "I want you to make me a promise&mdash;yes,
two of them."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Will you promise?"</p>

<p>"If I can."</p>

<p>"Of course you can. The first is, that, if you get
into any trouble where I can help you, you'll let me
know. Do you promise that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise that; and I thank you for being
such a dear good brother."</p>

<p>"The second is, that, whatever happens, you won't
marry Frank Breck."</p>

<p>"But, Will"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No: no buts. Either promise, or don't promise;
but don't put in ifs and buts."</p>

<p>"But I must. There is aunt Tabitha."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Tabitha be hanged! I beg your pardon;
but she has always used you shamefully, bossing you
round, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"We agreed long ago," she interrupted, "not to
discuss her."</p>

<p>"Very well. Only I wish you'd promise me."</p>

<p>"How can I, when I might not be able to keep
my promise?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Ease!" he exclaimed, springing
up, and pacing excitedly to and fro on the greensward.
"It is enough to make a man go mad to hear you
talk in that cold-blooded way about marrying Frank
Breck. You can't marry him; and, what's more, you
sha'n't marry him!"</p>

<p>"Hark!" she said.</p>

<p>They heard the sound of wheels, stopping immediately
after upon the bridge, and then the voice of
Burleigh Blood.</p>

<p>"It isn't Flossy," Will said.</p>

<p>"It must be," Ease answered. "There, don't you
hear her call?"</p>

<p>"What of it? Let her go home. When she finds
we are not there, they'll send back for us. I want to
talk to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" Ease said, hurrying along towards
the bridge. "Aunt Tabitha didn't want me to come,
anyway, and she'd be wild if she knew we hadn't
been to church."</p>

<p>"I should think you were old enough to decide
something for yourself," he growled, giving her his
hand to help her over the stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The buggy would hardly accommodate four: so
Burleigh was forced to complete his journey on foot,
the others driving merrily away with bantering good-bys.
They had driven only a short distance when they
encountered a buggy driven violently.</p>

<p>"Why, isn't that Tom Putnam?" exclaimed Will.
"What on earth's got him?"</p>

<p>"And this horrid, bold-looking woman with him,"
Flossy remarked reflectively.</p>

<h3>A CHAPTER OF SHREDS AND PATCHES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Monday</span> morning found the young people at
the Sanford cottage in rather indifferent spirits.
When the sun, after having fought his way through
clouds to do so, awoke Patty, the sound which his
beams evoked from her lips was not, like that of
Memnon, a note of joy, but a sigh. Flossy announced
at breakfast a severe attack of her dyspepsia, caused,
she declared, by the sermon to which she had listened
at Samoset.</p>

<p>"It was a dreadfully hard sermon," she said, "and
had more heads than a hydra. I'm not used to such
things, and it's no wonder it made me ill."</p>

<p>"I didn't hear it," Will remarked; "but it has given
me a headache all the same. It must be because I
have so many ideas. I shall lose my wits with the
pain some day, I've no doubt."</p>

<p>"If you do," Floss retorted, "you can advertise for
them as of no use but to the owner, like private papers."</p>

<p>"What nonsense you two talk!" grandmother Sanford
said mildly. "Dost thee think, William, that
friend Putnam has secured my pension yet?"</p>

<p>"I will try to find out to-day, grandmother, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
I've driven mother over to call on the young and
lovely bride, Mrs. Bathalina Peter Clemens Mixon."</p>

<p>From the time of the sudden and romantic departure
of Bathalina, the life of Mrs. Sanford had been made
a burden by the trial of new servants. She utterly
refused to have anybody about her who was Irish; yet
the servants she had tried had proved alike a weariness
to the flesh and a vexation to the spirit. They
were principally farmers' daughters, who "never thought
o' livin' out, but would stop a spell, jes' to 'commodate."
In Montfield everybody knew his neighbor's
affairs; and the friends of the family had been sending
in a continuous stream of candidates, or messages
respecting girls they thought might be available, or
concerning people who might know of girls to hire,
or have heard of somebody who did. Even Mrs.
Brown at length became aware of the vacancy in the
Sanfords' kitchen, and sent over a girl whom she
recommended as being all that the most exacting
could desire. It proved to be the same amiable
domestic who had dealt such destruction among
Mrs. Brown's hairpins; and for various reasons her
first morning at the doctor's cottage was also her
last.</p>

<p>"What could you expect," Mrs. Sanford said, "of
a girl Mrs. Brown recommended? She's no kind of a
housekeeper. She'd be sure to have a pig killed on
the wane of the moon. And she's like one of her own
doughnuts: she's no sort or kind of life nor sconce,
but tough as leather to bite, if you are ever hungry
enough to want to eat one. I declare I am worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
almost to a shadow with trying girls, and not getting
one fit to live with."</p>

<p>But at last a ray of light had shone through the
clouds. Bathalina Mixon had sent word that her
experience of wedded bliss was not, on the whole,
satisfactory, and that she was willing to return and
be forgiven. So Mrs. Sanford and Will were going to
treat with the repentant bride, and if possible arrange
for her return.</p>

<p>"She ain't more than half-witted," Mrs. Sanford
said; "but I've concluded that's an advantage; and
she knows the ways of the house, and is afraid of the
doctor."</p>

<p>Few couples were ever more ill-assorted than Dr.
Sanford and his wife; but the husband bore with
admirable patience the follies which experience had
taught him it was idle to hope to eradicate. His keen
sense of humor aided him in this forbearance, and
a remark of his wife's more than usually grotesque, had
no other visible effect upon him than to provoke a
quiet smile about the corners of his lips. The doctor
was unspeakably fond of his children, and in them
found something of the companionship denied him
with his wife. Will was to succeed his father in his
practice, and was already studying with that in view.
For Patty her father could not bear to plan a future,
since he could not endure the thought of separation.
Her wooers had made little impression upon
him, but he frowned decidedly upon Clarence Toxteth.</p>

<p>"I do not like the breed," he said to his wife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
"The Toxteth blood doesn't seem to have any brain-making
power in it."</p>

<p>"I think anybody must have brains to get money,"
Mrs. Sanford answered. "They've got that, at any
rate, and only one son for it to go to."</p>

<p>"One son of that kind," her husband returned grimly,
"is a great plenty."</p>

<p>Towards Mr. Putnam the doctor's attitude was not
hostile, but rather that of one who reserved his opinion.
He postponed in his mind the consideration of
these things, as if by so doing he could delay the
inevitable, and retain his favorite child the longer in
the home-nest.</p>

<p>But all this has no very intimate connection with
the visit which Mrs. Sanford and her son had set out
to pay to Mrs. Mixon. They found her in a dilapidated
building in the outskirts of Samoset, which had
been built as a tenement for the hands in a cotton-mill
now burned. Hither Peter had conveyed his
bride, when, flushed with eager love, she flew to his
arms from the funeral of her cousin's child; and for
a week he had treated her with the utmost consideration,
having an eye to her money.</p>

<p>"The shekels naturally belong in the husband's
hands," he said, "and you'd better let me take care
of them. These banks are slippery things, and I've
no confidence in those Samoset fellers anyway. I'll
get it, and you can call on me for cash when you want
it."</p>

<p>Whether her call would be answered was a question
the foolish wife unfortunately forgot to consider; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
into the rascal's pocket went the savings which Dr.
Sanford had taken pains to have Bathalina lay by.
Mixon's tenderness decreased in the same proportion
as his bride's funds; and, when once he had obtained
them all, the amiable Peter was amiable no longer.
He began a course of reckless abuse, developing
an imaginative ingenuity in the invention of curses
and opprobrious epithets, which was wonderful to
hear.</p>

<p>"I bore livin' with him as long as I could," Bathalina
afterward confided to aunty Jeff; "but one day
it was borne in upon me that I was unequally yoked
with unbelievers, and I made up my mind, that, as it
wasn't much of a marriage anyway, I wouldn't have
no more to do with him. So I told him if he'd go
over to Montfield, and ask Mis' Sanford would she take
me back, I'd get out of his way, and he might marry
'Mandy West for what I cared."</p>

<p>The arrangements for Bathalina's return were easily
concluded, and Mrs. Sanford and Will set out towards
home once more. They drove rapidly, as the clouds
were every moment becoming more threatening. Fate,
however, had her purposes in their going, and interposed
by breaking beneath the wheels of their carriage
a decayed culvert. The buggy was overturned,
mother and son being suddenly and unceremoniously
tumbled in an undignified heap into the carriage-top.
The horse stopped of his own will in spite of the
alarming outcry of Mrs. Sanford, who moaned and
shrieked, and wailed and lamented, while her son
fished her from the wreck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'What can wringing of the hands do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which is ordained, to alter?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he remarked coolly.</p>

<p>"Will," his mother exclaimed, "do stop quoting
things till we see if we are alive!"</p>

<p>A consultation ensued, if so it could be called where
the lady refused to consult. Mrs. Sanford was far too
plump to walk, and could hardly be expected to mount,
and ride on horseback. There seemed no alternative
but for her to remain where she was while her son
went to the nearest farmhouse, a mile away, for a
carriage.</p>

<p>When Will returned from his search, which was
somewhat prolonged by the necessity of going to
several places, his mother had disappeared. The
cushions were piled up in the broken carriage; so he
concluded that the lady's taking-off had not been
violent, and followed the homeward road himself.</p>

<p>His way lay by Mullen House, the home of Ease
Apthorpe and her aunt, Miss Tabitha Mullen. The
mansion stood at some distance from the street, a
stone wall surrounding the grounds. The principal
entrance was an imposing gateway, whose iron gates
were religiously closed at night, but stood open by day.
As Sanford rode near, his eyes were greeted by a
strange spectacle. In the gateway he saw Peter Mixon
defending the passage against an angry woman, who,
half crazed with drink or drugs, was loudly insisting
upon entering. The woman's dark hair fell in tangled
masses over her shoulders, and her handsome throat
was bared by the neglect of her dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you I will go in!" she screamed, just as Will
rode within hearing. "I will go in and claim my own,
in spite of them! Get out of my way, or I'll kill you!"</p>

<p>She looked equal to the execution of her threat as
she ended with a terrible oath, her eyes flashing, her
bosom heaving, and her hands clinched. Mixon
made some reply inaudible to young Sanford, evidently
intended to soothe or cow the woman; but liquor had
carried her beyond restraint.</p>

<p>"Putnam!" she vociferated scornfully. "What do
I care for him! I'll cut his throat too, if I get hold
of him! Get out of my way, or"&mdash;</p>

<p>At this instant the sound of Sanford's horse's feet
attracted her attention, and she turned towards him.
Mixon took advantage of the diversion to seize her by
the arm, and hurry her away.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he said, with every appearance of
confusion. "Don't you see who is coming?"</p>

<p>The woman stared, evidently not comprehending
in the least who the new-comer was; but she allowed
herself to be led away, swearing and threatening as
she went.</p>

<p>Will at this moment recognized the woman as the
one whom he had met driving towards Samoset with
Tom Putnam.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXIX." id="ChXIX.">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<h3>TOXTETH SEEKS AN ALLY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sanford</span> was so round, so plump, so
rosy, that, as she sat enthroned among the carriage-cushions,
she might easily have been mistaken
for an unusually fine specimen of Dutch cabbage, by
the wand of some new Rübezahl endowed with life.
The poor lady was much frightened, not at any thing
in particular, but in a general way. She had a vague
idea that something astounding and destructive might
take place at any moment: she had a misty notion
that lions and tigers came out of forests to devour
people; and she distinctly recalled the fact that her
grandfather had once shot a wolf in the neighborhood,
perhaps in these very woods which rustled and murmured
so ominously behind her.</p>

<p>An unusual situation, even the most trivial, which
delivers shallow minds to reflection, is for them full of
uneasiness. To be given up to self is the most frightful
of catastrophes to him who finds self an utter
stranger. If Mrs. Sanford had no great power of
reasoning, she was not without a fancy which fear
stirred into activity; and, by the time she had been
alone five minutes, her terror had become ludicrously
great. A squirrel scampering across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
road called from her a scream, which was quickly
stifled by the thought that an outcry would be likely
to attract beasts of prey. A crow flew overhead; and
that presager of evil filled her with terror unutterable.
The fact that she was alone on a road much
travelled, and but three or four miles from her own
home, seems an insufficient cause for such fear; but
Mrs. Sanford could hardly have suffered more mental
anguish if deposited with Daniel in the den of
lions.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sound of approaching
wheels, and this sign of human proximity revived her
drooping courage. As the moments had seemed hours
to her, she thought her son had already returned; but
a glimpse of the tossing manes of a span of grays told
her that it was the Toxteth equipage which approached.
Her mind yielded to an entirely new sensation, as a
fluff of thistledown is lightly blown about.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Toxteth shall never see me in such a position
as this," she said to herself. "I wouldn't demean
myself by letting her know who it is."</p>

<p>So the foolish woman, who had, in common with the
ostrich, the feeling, that, if her head was concealed,
her entire person must be invisible, spread the corner
of her shawl over her face, and sat motionless. The
carriage drew nearer, and stopped, a man's voice asking
who was there. As the veiled figure returned no
answer, Clarence Toxteth, for he it was, jumped out,
and approached the lady.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked. "Do you want help?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "Go away!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Sanford!" he said, recognizing the
voice. "What has happened? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>Being recognized, the lady uncovered her face, and
said with acerbity,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I'm not killed, I'm sure it isn't my fault. I am
so shaken, I doubt I shall ever get over it."</p>

<p>The young man, being fortunately alone, took the
lady into his own carriage and drove on, leaving the
wreck of the buggy to Will's care.</p>

<p>"I doubt but it's a forerunner of a bad sign," Mrs.
Sanford said as they drove along. "I always heard it
was unlucky to break down."</p>

<p>"It was lucky for me, at least," young Toxteth answered
gallantly. "I am glad you were not hurt."</p>

<p>"But the shock to my mind, I being as fleshy as
I am," she returned rather illogically, "was dreadful."</p>

<p>They drove smoothly along, Clarence secretly considering
how he might best broach a subject of which
his mind was full.</p>

<p>"I've wanted to see you for a long time," he
began.</p>

<p>"Those that want to see me," Mrs. Sanford retorted,
in a tone which showed that her temper had been a
little shaken by her mishap, "usually come where I
am."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" he said, somewhat confused. "But I
wanted to see you without its being known."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to leave me anywhere on the
road, do you?" she demanded in alarm. "I don't
know as it'll hurt your reputation if folks do know
you've seen me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! You misunderstand me entirely."</p>

<p>"Then, I wish you'd speak plainer."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, driven abruptly to the point, "it
was about Patty I wanted to speak."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Merely writing the interjection indicates but feebly
the emotions filling the breast of Mrs. Sanford when
she gave it utterance. Like Lady Geraldine's answer,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"It lies there on the paper,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mere word without her accent."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Surprise, gratification, triumph, were commingled in
her voice. She laid her plump hands together complacently.
The doctor's wife loved her son best, as
such women necessarily do; but she was proud of
Patty, and particularly anxious that she should marry
advantageously. Here, was a bridegroom who could
deck her daughter in purple and scarlet, and fine-twined
linen. Already in fancy the ladybug mother
saw herself riding behind this handsome span of dappled
grays, not as a stranger, but with all the rights of
a mother-in-law. Hers was one of those vulgar natures
which instinctively regarded marriage as a contract
wherein a woman brought her charms to market to
be disposed of to the highest bidder. She unconsciously
rustled and plumed herself like a pigeon in
the sun.</p>

<p>"I am well enough able to marry," Clarence said;
"and my wife would have all her heart would wish."</p>

<p>Nature endows weak and sensuous minds with a
species of protective instinct, which sometimes serves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
them as well as the acutest reason. Young Toxteth
used the argument which was best calculated to touch
the fancy of Mrs. Sanford; and it was so good a
choice as to be almost shrewdness, that he had
selected that lady as his confidante. In her he found
an eager listener, whereas no other member of Dr.
Sanford's family would have heard him through his
first purseproud remark.</p>

<p>"I have been fond of her for a long time," Toxteth
continued. "I didn't pay her particular attentions
until I was sure of myself, of course."</p>

<p>"Very honorable, I'm sure," chirruped Mrs. Sanford,&mdash;"very
honorable, indeed."</p>

<p>"I think she likes me," the suitor continued, the
admiring attitude of his listener betraying him into more
and more frankness. "She's never said so; but I'm
sure I don't see why she shouldn't like me, and she
naturally wouldn't speak until I did."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no!" acquiesced the gratified mother.
"Naturally not."</p>

<p>"But girls are so queer," he said, hesitating a little,
now that the real purpose of the interview was reached.
"She doesn't consider how she hurts my feelings, and
she might say she didn't care for me when she really
did, you know. And if you would&mdash;why, if you
would speak to her, and&mdash;and prepare her a little,
you know, so that it shall not be so unexpected to her."</p>

<p>"I trust I know my duty," replied his companion,
nodding her head with great complacency; "and you
may certainly count on me. Patty can't help seeing
the great advantages of being your wife, and it's very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
good of you to ask her. Though, to be sure, she may
pick and choose of the best in Montfield, and doesn't
have to go begging for a husband, as some girls do.
It isn't every man I'd say yes to, by any manner of
means."</p>

<p>And at this moment the carriage stopped at the gate
of the Sanford cottage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A rehearsal was held that evening at Dessie Farnum's.
Will's headache prevented his attendance; but
his part was read, and things went as smoothly as is
usual on such occasions. Flossy showed a desire to
recite the whole of the scenes in which she took part;
but as they chanced to be principally between herself
and Burleigh Blood, who knew few of his lines,
this was rather a help.</p>

<p>"If you were only a ventriloquist, Flossy," Patty
said, "Burleigh need do nothing but act bashful, and
you could do all the talking."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I couldn't learn," Flossy returned,
beginning to repeat Burleigh's part in a deep voice,
which made them all laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall have to learn myself," Blood
said, "unless you can do better than that."</p>

<p>"Better than that! What base ingratitude!"</p>

<p>"Are these plates old-fashioned enough?" Dessie
asked. "They were my grandmother's."</p>

<p>"Do!" exclaimed Flossy. "They are rapturous!
Oh the things we shall have to eat off them!"</p>

<p>"What will you have? Brown-bread and beans, I
suppose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! Chicken-salad and Charlotte-Russes.
I am glad I'm going to be Waitstill Eastman.
I couldn't have stood it to see anybody else eating,
and I left out. It must certainly be salad and Charlottes."</p>

<p>"Salads and Charlotte-Russes for an old-fashioned
supper!" retorted Patty. "Indeed, miss, you'll have
nothing of the kind. Pumpkin-pies and nut-cakes
are the best you'll get."</p>

<p>"It is no matter," Flossy answered. "It is a great
deal better to talk about things than it is to eat them,
after all."</p>

<p>"Flossy never really eats much of any thing but
pop-corn," her cousin explained. "You'd think, to
hear her talk, that her life was one long feast."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do! I eat enormously; but I don't
think it is so good as reading about nice things.
Now, I like to read Dickens's books, because they're
always having something to eat or to drink in them.
Think of the cold punch now, the lovely cold
punch!"</p>

<p>"Flossy, I'm ashamed of you!" exclaimed Patty.
"I do believe you are tipsy, just thinking about it;
and you make me too thirsty for any thing."</p>

<p>"Your reproof convicts yourself," put in Frank
Breck. "I am sorry you can't hear punch mentioned
without being thirsty."</p>

<p>"I am glad if you can," she retorted.</p>

<p>The hit was a palpable one, for the young man had
the reputation of walking in ways far removed from
the paths of sobriety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>When the rehearsal was concluded, the rain fell in
torrents. Burleigh, who had his buggy, offered to take
Patty and Flossy home. The former declined the
invitation, although insisting that her cousin should
ride. For herself, Patty delighted in the rain. The
excitement of the storm exhilarated her, filling her
with a delightful animal joy in living. She was fond
of taking long walks in rainy weather, greatly to the
disturbance of her mother, who had neither sympathy
nor patience with this side of her daughter's nature.
Even grandmother, who usually found whatever Patty
did perfect, felt called upon to remonstrate against
these escapades. But to the girl the struggle with
the storm was delightful: it was a keen pleasure to
feel the rain beat upon her face, and her young blood
tingled under the cold touch. So to-night she chose
to walk home, and meant to escape alone. She was
prevented by Hazard Breck, who forestalled young
Toxteth in seeking the honor of escorting her. As
they left the house, Patty's quick ear caught a word
or two between Ease Apthorpe and Frank Breck.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she heard Ease say. "I will not
trouble you."</p>

<p>"Your aunt charged me to see you safe home," he
answered. "I shouldn't want to disobey her."</p>

<p>And as usual Ease yielded.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXX." id="ChXX.">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<h3>AN OUTBURST.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hazard</span>," Patty asked, as they went splashing
through the puddles, "is Frank in earnest
with Ease? Does he really care for her?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," he answered slowly. "He never
makes a confidant of me."</p>

<p>"He persecutes her," Patty continued. "I wish
he'd let her alone. She's too meek to stand out
against him. I ought not to say this to you, but it
makes me angry. Why are you so sober lately? You
are as solemn as Bathalina."</p>

<p>"Am I? I wasn't aware of it."</p>

<p>"But of course you know what is troubling you."</p>

<p>"It does little good to talk over such things," he
said.</p>

<p>"Such things as what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"As&mdash;as being solemn."</p>

<p>"You've some sort of a deadly secret preying upon
your mind, Hazard. That I am sure of. Now, I
insist upon knowing what it is."</p>

<p>"I haven't any secret now," he answered rather
mournfully.</p>

<p>Hazard was, after all, only a boy, though a very
noble and manly one. He adored Patty with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
ardor of a pure boy's first passion; a light which, if
extinguished, leaves the very blackness of despair in
the boyish heart; a dream from which the waking is
very bitter. The lad whose first love is ill-starred
refuses to believe that he can ever love again, that any
sun will rise after this brilliant meteor-flash has faded.</p>

<p>Hazard had not for a moment entertained the
possibility of contesting his uncle's right to Patty.
He was too loyal, too devoted to the man who had
unostentatiously made so many sacrifices to him and
his. In the lonely walk he had taken Sunday afternoon,
when aunt Pamela had spoken of Putnam's
love, the young man had fought with himself, and
conquered. When he met Patty on the bridge, she
was to him as belonging to another. There was in
the lad a high chivalry, which caused him to regard
things in a noble if somewhat overstrained temper.
Mr. Putnam to him was not merely the uncle to
whom he was warmly attached, but also the generous
benefactor who had not spared himself to save the
name and the welfare of his nephews. Hazard was not
ignorant, that, but for Putnam, his father might have
been publicly branded as the felon he was; and he
knew, too, that sacrifices made to shield him had
crippled his uncle's fortune. That this had prevented
Tom's seeking from Patty the love which his nephew
felt to be richly his due, was an added reason why in
this, most of all things, no obstacle should come
between Mr. Putnam and his desire. The boy's self-renunciation
was a little Quixotic; but who more
sadly noble than the crazy knight of La Mancha?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, however, limits to all human endurance.
To suffer and be strong is possible to many: to suffer
and be silent is within the power of but few. Hazard
had resolved never to speak of his love; but no one
can judge the strength of a resolution until it has been
tried by opportunity. There suddenly rushed over
him a wave of boyish despair. One who voluntarily
renounces pursuit, generally believes that he might
have won; and to Hazard his act seemed the renunciation
of a prize surely his.</p>

<p>"Life is so hard!" he burst out suddenly, with all
the hopelessness of despairing twenty.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Patty returned lightly. "As Flossy
says, 'life would be very pleasant, if it were not so
much trouble to live.'"</p>

<p>"But to live is so much trouble," he answered.
"See what a life I've had! I wasn't asked if I wanted
it; and, when I had been made to live, I didn't have
my choice about it, in any way. You know that my
father was a constant trouble to us,&mdash;everybody knew
that,&mdash;and we all had to endure to be pitied; and pity
is always half contempt."</p>

<p>"O Hazard!"</p>

<p>"Of course I don't mean from you," he said
illogically enough; "but it is the truth. Then, mother
was just worn into her grave by grief and poverty; and
we boys had to stand by helpless, and see it."</p>

<p>Patty was at a loss how to answer him, and wisely
said little. Hazard was usually so bright, and seemed
of so happy a disposition, that this outburst was the
more bewildering. Ignorant of the cause which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
worked his old pains to the surface, Patty's only
thought was of how deep must have been the sorrow
of his boyhood to have left so much bitterness behind.
She knew in a vague way that Mr. Breck had been a
dissipated, unprincipled man, who had ill-treated his
family, and been a scandal to the neighborhood until
he moved out of it to take up his residence in Boston.
She had no means of knowing how sad a childhood
had been that of Hazard,&mdash;a life so shaded, that only
an unusually fine temperament, and the noble disposition
inherited from his mother, had prevented his
becoming morbidly gloomy. Partly because she knew
not what to say, and partly from an instinctive feeling
that talking would relieve Hazard's overwrought mood,
she let him continue.</p>

<p>"I have never had any good from life for myself,"
he went on with increasing vehemence, "and I am
sure I have never helped my friends to any. I've
been a dead weight on those I wanted most to help;
and, if I am ever fond of anybody, we are either separated,
or something happens to spoil our friendship.
Frank and I never had any thing in common; and
now he is all the time plaguing Ease Apthorpe, or
travelling about with that vile Mixon."</p>

<p>"Who is Mixon?" asked Patty. "Not Bathalina's
husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes: that's the one. The old scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"What has Frank to do with him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sometimes I think it's only fondness
for low company, and then at others fancy he has
some sort of a secret of Frank's. He was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
father's dogs; sometimes hostler, sometimes waiter, or
footman, or whatever happened. Father had a strange
liking for his company, and Mixon could manage him
when nobody else could come near him. Why, I've
seen father lay his pistols on the table, and dare one
of us to stir, and then go on drinking, and flinging the
dishes at one or another of us, till Peter heard the
racket, and came, and took the revolvers away. Nobody
else in the house dared dispute any thing father
did. It is a pleasant childhood to remember, isn't it?
And it is pleasant to think that Mixon may know
some secret which would disgrace us all if it were
told."</p>

<p>"Now, Hazard," Patty said soothingly, "you shouldn't
talk of these things. You make them worse than they
ever were, and at worst they are passed now. Then
you have always your uncle to help you and to advise
with."</p>

<p>"Uncle Tom? There's where it hurts worse than
all. We have always been a drag on him. If it were
not for us, he might have been married long ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" his companion returned hastily, with a
pang in her heart. "You don't know what you are
saying."</p>

<p>"But I do. Even aunt Pamela sees it, and spoke
to me of it."</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what?" he broke in fiercely, his passion and
pain sweeping away all his reserve. "Oh, I know
what you would say! You think you might have a
voice in the matter. I tell you, Patty Sanford, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
trifled with uncle Tom, I should hate you as much as
I love you now."</p>

<p>"Hazard Breck, you are crazy!"</p>

<p>"I know I am crazy. I've been crazy all summer.
I was crazy thinking I was coming to Montfield because
I should see you; and since I came I've been wild
night and day because you were alive in the same
town, because"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! For pity's sake, hush!" she cried.</p>

<p>Then she laid her other hand upon his arm, which
she already held.</p>

<p>"I have completely forgotten every word we have
spoken to-night," she said.</p>

<p>The tone, the words, affected him like a sudden
dash of ice-cold water. He strode on through the
rain in silence, suddenly feeling now how his heart
beat, and his blood rushed tingling through his veins.
They had nearly reached Dr. Sanford's cottage when
he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "You were always
too good to me. I think I have been out of my head
to-night."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I be good to you?" she returned.
"You have always been good to me. So old friends
as we are don't need to apologize to each other. I
dare say we all say foolish things sometimes."</p>

<p>He winced a little, but did not dissent. As they
went up the path together between the dripping shrubs
which glimmered in the light from the windows, they
heard Will's voice.</p>

<p>"There is Will singing," Patty said. "He always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sings when he has a headache. He insists that dying
swans sing on account of the pain in their heads."</p>

<p>"That has been the trouble with me," Hazard
answered, smiling faintly. "I've had my swan-song&mdash;unless
you call it a hiss. But my pain was not in my
head. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Patty said to herself, looking after him, "the
pain in your heart isn't sharper than in mine."</p>

<h3>THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">This</span> must be the liner," Mrs. Sanford declared
upon the following morning, looking out at the
pouring rain. "I doubt Bathalina will not come to-day."</p>

<p>The event proved her mistaken; for Mrs. Mixon
walked over from Samoset, despite the storm, her
bundles hanging about her until she looked like one
of the seven wives of the man met upon the road
to St. Ives. Flossy saw her coming up the walk
which led to the kitchen-door, the water streaming
from every fold and end of her garments and belongings.</p>

<p>"Behold a water-nymph!" she said. "She's so
fond of washing, I suppose she feels as if she were
in her native element."</p>

<p>"She looks a good deal like an angel dragged
through a brush-fence into a world of bitterness and
woe," commented Will.</p>

<p>"There are marriages of convenience," Patty said;
"but Bathalina certainly made a marriage of inconvenience."</p>

<p>"Let's go and see her," proposed Flossy.</p>

<p>To the kitchen they all trooped. Mrs. Sanford was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
there before them, alternately scolding the returned
prodigal, and pitying herself.</p>

<p>"The trials I've been through since you left," she
said, "are beyond mortal belief. How you could
have the heart to leave me in the lurch so, Bathalina,
is more than I know. 'Light come, light go,' as the
old saying is; and I doubt you've proved it by this
time with that husband of yours."</p>

<p>"But it is too bad you've left him, Bathalina!"
Flossy put in. "You've no idea how becoming a
husband was to you. You ought never to go without
one."</p>

<p>"Where is your other half?" Will asked. "You
and he are only one between you, you know."</p>

<p>"In courtin'," answered Bathalina sententiously,
rising to the height of the occasion,&mdash;"in courtin'
there may be only one, but in marriage there's two."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he laughed. "You've learned something.
That's worthy of Emerson. Allow me to
add," he continued with mock solemnity, "that it is a
truth as old as the universe, that one plus one is two."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come," said Flossy; "for you do
make such good things to eat. The last girl we had,
made bread so sour that I couldn't eat it without feeling
as if angle-worms were crawling down my back.
So you don't like being married, Bathalina?"</p>

<p>"It was all for my sinful pride," the servant answered
lugubriously, "that I was left to be Peter Mixon's wife.
And, if ever you come to be that, you'll repent with
your harps hanged on the willows, as the tune says."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Patty, "I think Mr. Mixon will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
be a widower, if you don't get off those wet clothes
soon."</p>

<p>"I doubt he will," assented Mrs. Sanford. "Why
she came over in them is more than I can see."</p>

<p>"There, mother," Will said, "I fear your head has
been turned by the Irish girls you've sent away."</p>

<p>"It's a mercy I'm spared to come back at all," Mrs.
Mixon said. "We all have more mercies than we
deserve."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," her mistress retorted.
"Speak for yourself. I don't know as I have any
more than I'm entitled to."</p>

<p>It was not in accordance with Bathalina's principles
to exhibit any satisfaction at being once more in her
old home; but, as she indulged in the most sad of her
minors, it was inferred that she was well pleased.
She continually bolted into the sitting-room to ask
some question, apparently for the sake of feasting her
eyes upon the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>"What do you put in squash-pies for seasoning?" she
inquired, interrupting an earnest conversation between
Mrs. Sanford and Mrs. Brown; the latter having, in
these stormy autumn days, just got to her spring calls.</p>

<p>"Why, Bathalina, you know as well as I!" was the
answer.</p>

<p>"Well, supposin' I do. Can't I have the satisfaction
of askin' when I've been living in tumbledown Irishy
places over to Samoset?"</p>

<p>"The girl must have been wandering in her mind
when she went off to be married," remarked grandmother
Sanford, smiling serenely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was wandering in her body, at least," replied
Patty.</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure," said Mrs. Brown. "And, now I
think of it, I don't know how I shall get home. My
girl's gone too. She says she gave me a week's warning,
but I'm sure I haven't begun to get ready for her
to go yet. I must try to get things picked up so we
can wash to-morrow or next day, and it rains worse
than ever."</p>

<p>The caller had ridden over with Dr. Sanford, whom
she had hailed as he passed her door.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'They that wash on Friday.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>quoted Flossy under her breath to Patty&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"'Wash for need.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'They that wash on Saturday,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh, they are sluts indeed!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>retorted her cousin. "They won't get at it before
that time."</p>

<p>"I shall be ready after dinner," Mrs. Brown continued.
"I guess Selina can pick up a pie or something
for Joe.&mdash;Did I tell you, Mrs. Sanford, that
we've heard from my cousin over to Samoset? He
ain't really my cousin, only for marrying Eliza. But I
feel for Eliza, I'm sure. He's run off with another
woman, and Eliza's left to bring up her three boys.
It's a mercy they ain't girls."</p>

<p>"I declare it's awful!" her hostess said. "Who
was the woman?"</p>

<p>"She was the daughter of that Smithers woman that&mdash;you
know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The hostess gave an emphatic nod of the head, as
if to indicate that she was aware of some mysterious
wickedness connected with the female in question.</p>

<p>"But where did she come from?" she asked. "I
thought she went off when Mr. Mullen died."</p>

<p>"Yes, she did," Mrs. Brown assented. "But such
folks always turn up again. And the strangest thing
about it is,"&mdash;and here her voice sank to a confidential
whisper,&mdash;"that they say Mr. Putnam"&mdash;</p>

<p>The entrance of Patty, who had been to make
arrangements for the transfer of Mrs. Brown to her
own home, put an abrupt end to the conversation.
But the hint conveyed had not dropped upon barren
soil. Mrs. Brown knew merely that Mrs. Smithers, in
her first surprise and dismay at the flight of her daughter,
had driven over to Montfield for Mr. Putnam. But
before she slept that night, the doctor's wife had conveyed
to Patty an impression that the most dreadful
stories were told of the relations between the lawyer
and this castaway. Patty treated the scandal with contempt;
yet she could not but remember that Flossy
had met her lover on the road to Samoset, and that
Will had heard his name at the gates of Mullen House.</p>

<p>"Will will take you home when he carries Floss to
rehearsal," Patty said as she entered. "We are going
to Mrs. Shankland's."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ChXXII." id="ChXXII.">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>
<h3>A MISUNDERSTANDING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this way it came about that Patty started alone
for the afternoon rehearsal. The rain was still
falling, although less heavily than in the earlier part of
the day. The wet leaves which the wind had torn
from the trees lay thick upon the walks, crushing soddenly
under her feet. The dreariness of autumn
seemed suddenly to have fallen upon the land, and
nature to have yielded to it without a struggle. The
weeds by the roadside were beaten down and broken;
the streets were full of pools of turbid water, which
reflected dismally the dark sky. The bright glow of
the autumnal foliage had been apparently washed
away by the torrents of rain, leaving the landscape
gray and drear.</p>

<p>Patty was out of sorts, and even the walk in the rain
failed to restore her spirits. She did not at all understand
the way in which Tom Putnam kept himself
aloof. That a man should make a declaration of love,
and then treat its object with quiet neglect, was incomprehensible
enough. She recalled that night when he
had found her on the doorstep, and contrasted it with
his manner on Sunday afternoon in the Castle in the
Air. She was unable to understand how Tom, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
indeed he loved her, could meet her with calmness;
and it was but a step further to conclude that she did
not possess his heart. She secretly resolved to meet
the lawyer with an indifference to which his should be
as nothing; to be colder than ice, as unconcerned as
a statue, and as firm as the Pyramids. Raising her
eyes at this point of her revery, she saw her lover
coming towards her down the village street. She felt
a glow of pleasure in spite of herself. With a girl like
Patty, no method of wooing could have been more
effectual than that which circumstances had forced
upon the lawyer, although he had felt keenly the loss
of her society.</p>

<p>"I am so glad I have met you!" he said. "I was
going to your house, but now I will walk on with
you."</p>

<p>Patty was steadying her nerves, and sending back
the rebellious blood, which would bound at sight of
his tall figure, as he turned and walked at her side.</p>

<p>"I have been so occupied!" he continued. "The
executors of Mrs. Sutcliff's estate have been at me
night and day. First it is a telegram, and then a
letter; and, as I've had Judge Hopcroft's business on
my hands since he has been ill, it has kept me very
much occupied. I am glad it is about done with. I
think I have earned all the money I shall get twice
over."</p>

<p>"You are very grateful," Patty said, with an exasperating
desire to say something disagreeable.</p>

<p>"Grateful! Of course, I am; but I do not like
to be kept always away from you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! You have always yourself for company;
and, being a man, according to your theory that
ought to suffice."</p>

<p>"But I pity you," he returned lightly. "The
other half of my theory is, that you need company."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I've had all I wanted."</p>

<p>He made no reply. He perceived easily that
something vexed her, but he could not understand
her annoyance. He had been desirous of being near
Patty, but, deeply occupied, had not been unhappy
away from her. Desire and hope will make a man
happy, though separated from the object of his passion,
where a woman will pine painfully for his
presence. A man may be, for a time, content with
love; while woman is happy only with the lover.</p>

<p>Tom Putnam did not doubt that Patty loved him;
and he was unable to understand why the knowledge
of his love did not make her content, as this assurance
did him. He was too old and too stable to
follow the changes of her mental atmosphere, or to
appreciate the hungry longing which made her desire
to annihilate her being in his, to have him utterly
her own. His love was as yet half impersonal,
almost dormant from the effect of long years of self-repression.
A man, too, must learn those secrets of
affection which the other sex know by instinct; and, if
the knowledge be not gained before the flush of youth
is passed, even a passionate nature may prove a slow
pupil.</p>

<p>The two friends walked on without speaking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
several moments, until, for Patty, the silence became
intolerable.</p>

<p>"You have been too much taken up with your own
affairs, I suppose," she said, "to trouble yourself
about grandmother's pension."</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "I was coming to see about
that this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Then it wasn't to see me at all," she returned.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, smiling. "That is better. You
really do care, then, whether I come to see you, or
not."</p>

<p>"I do not care a straw," she retorted, vexed more
and more, both with herself and him. "Only I do
not like to have people sail under false colors."</p>

<p>"I don't see the application."</p>

<p>"No matter. What is it about the pension?"</p>

<p>"There is a little trouble."</p>

<p>"Of course. I knew you'd be too much taken
up with your own affairs. The money's a trifle; but
grandmother is an old lady, and will be so disappointed."</p>

<p>"I think the matter may be arranged," he said
gravely, ignoring her taunt. "I am very sorry for the
delay."</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I find it hard to prove your grandmother's marriage."</p>

<p>"What!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I have not been able to find proof of your grandmother's
marriage."</p>

<p>"Tom Putnam!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have examined the town-records in vain," he
continued; "and she told me in the first place that
she had no certificate."</p>

<p>"And you dare to think she was never married!"</p>

<p>"Who said I thought that?" he returned, smiling
at her vehemence. "I have to look at things in a
legal light; and for this business she is to be considered
single until there's proof of her marriage
produced."</p>

<p>"You insult her and all the family," Patty said
hotly, all her Sanford blood rising in wrath. "I had,
at least, believed you a gentleman."</p>

<p>They had reached the Shanklands's gate; and she
left him without a word further, entering the house
with her head carried like that of an offended goddess.
As she came into the parlor, she encountered
a perfect whirlwind of voices in question, exclamation,
and remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"What made you so late?"</p>

<p>"O Patty! do you think we ought to have green
lights for the death-scene? It makes everybody look
so horridly ghastly."</p>

<p>"We've been waiting an age for you."</p>

<p>"There, there!" exclaimed Patty. "Please don't all
speak at once. I'm as cross as an Arab," she added,
forcing a smile; "and my name is a misnomer."</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't been quarrelling with Mr.
Putnam," Miss Sturtevant said maliciously from her
seat by the window. "I thought you left him rather
unceremoniously."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"At least I've not been prying into other people's
affairs," Patty retorted sweetly. "Come, let's begin."</p>

<p>Every thing went wrong that afternoon. Patty
could not prevent her mind's dwelling on her interview
with the lawyer, instead of upon the work in
hand. The direction of the rehearsals had been put
into her care as a matter of course; and her experience
in amateur theatricals was large enough to enable her
to get through her work half mechanically. She was
usually very careful; but to-day every one felt that
her mind was elsewhere, and each did what was right
in his own eyes.</p>

<p>They rehearsed first "The Faithful Jewess," a remarkable
tragedy selected by Miss Sturtevant, who
played in it the part of a weird prophetess, and got
herself up to look like the Witch of Endor. In choosing
the play, Miss Flora had had in mind the including
of Mr. Putnam in the cast,&mdash;a hope which had been
doomed to disappointment. That Miss Flora has been
absent so long from these pages results from no want
of activity upon the part of that energetic young lady.
She had waged constant warfare against the heart of
Tom Putnam; but so entirely fruitless had thus far
been her efforts, that they scarcely seemed worth
chronicling. The lawyer was too entirely engrossed
by his passion for Patty Sanford to amuse himself, even
had he been given to gallant trifling; and never was
sweetness more utterly wasted than that which Flora
lavished upon the unresponsive bachelor.</p>

<p>Nor had she been more successful in her attempts
to obtain possession of the papers which both Jacob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Wentworth and Frank Breck desired. She had indeed
made some efforts in that direction, being fully alive
to the advantages of herself holding so valuable documents,
and thus being in a position to dictate terms,
or dispose of her booty to the highest bidder. On the
whole, her unscrupulousness, her quick wit and practised
skill, had brought her nothing in her summer's
campaign but the now valuable bonds of the Samoset
and Brookfield Railroad.</p>

<h3>NOTES AND SOUVENIRS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I took</span> cold leaving off my apron," Mrs. Sanford
remarked. "I always do."</p>

<p>"That is a slight cause, daughter Britann," said
grandmother. "Do'st thee feel sure there was no
other?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I know when I take cold," she retorted.
"I always take cold if I leave off my apron;
and, if I go to a tea-party, I always wear my apron
under my dress."</p>

<p>"I declare!" exclaimed Patty, rushing in like a
whirlwind. "I'll never speak to that horrid Tom
Putnam again to the longest day I live!"</p>

<p>"Softly, softly," said the old lady. "Thee do'st not
wish to make promises and break them. What disturbs
thee?"</p>

<p>"It's about you, grandmother. He dared to say
you were not married."</p>

<p>"Not married?"</p>

<p>"Not married!" echoed Mrs. Sanford. "And your
family always held out to be so much better than ours,
and so leading me to marry into it, and help bear the
disgrace!"</p>

<p>"Hush, mother!" Patty said impatiently. "There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
isn't any disgrace. It is only a blunder of Mr. Putnam's."</p>

<p>"Then, your father ought to sue him for libel. I
always told you I didn't approve of your dawdling
about with that lawyer, with Clarence Toxteth at your
beck and call. But you always would have your own
way, and disgrace us all by keeping company with the
man that slanders your family."</p>

<p>"Slanders our family!" Patty returned, her eyes
blazing. "Who said he slandered the family? If he
isn't disgraced by my company, I'm sure I am not by
his. I shouldn't be ashamed to sweep the streets for
him to walk on!"</p>

<p>"You'd demean yourself, I dare say, when you
might have the streets swept for you."</p>

<p>"I"&mdash;began her daughter.</p>

<p>"Daughter Patience," interposed her grandmother,
laying her hand upon the girl's arm, "thee had best
not say it."</p>

<p>By a strong effort Patty repressed the retort which
had sprung to her lips.</p>

<p>"What does it mean, grandmother?" she asked,
when a moment's silence had given her more composure.
"Tom Putnam says he can find no proof of
your marriage."</p>

<p>"I told thy father to tell him to go to the town-records."</p>

<p>"He says he has, and it is not there."</p>

<p>"Then, the man that married us neglected his duty,"
the old lady said with gentle severity. "He was a
Methodist preacher at Quinnebasset; for we had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
one preacher here, and he was away; and that, as
thee knows, was before I received light to become a
Friend."</p>

<p>"But didn't you have a certificate?" asked Mrs.
Sanford.</p>

<p>"No. The man promised us one; but, though he
was a man of God, he kept his word no better than
one of the world's people, and we never got it."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" demanded Flossy,
entering. "I told Will I didn't think this play would
be very intelligible to the audience; and he said they
would have the advantage of the actors, if it were.
Was that what you were talking about?"</p>

<p>"Flossy," her aunt said disdainfully, "don't be so
silly!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, aunt Britann. I prefer to be silly."
So saying, she made her aunt a graceful courtesy, and
then sat down. "What were you talking about?"</p>

<p>Patty explained; and her cousin flourished her bowl
of pop-corn wildly about with excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Flossy burst out. "I knew there
was something sure to come of it when I ran away;
and there it was in the binding of this book, and the
pew was so hard I thought I should die. This cover,
you know, is almost torn off, and there's where Linda
Thaxter married William French; I mean Edward
French, no, Edward Sanford&mdash;at least you know what
I mean."</p>

<p>Flossy always became less and less intelligible as she
became excited; and Patty, knowing this by frequent
experience, seized her by both shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait!" she said. "Stop short there. Now, what
are you trying to say?"</p>

<p>By degrees they elicited from her the story of the
psalmody in the Presbyterian Church at Samoset; and
Dr. Sanford, when he came home, declared that this
might prove a decisive piece of evidence. He laughed
at Patty's anger, and requested her to write a note to
the lawyer, informing him of Flossy's story.</p>

<p>It amused him to see his daughter nibbling her pen
over the epistle she had vainly tried to avoid writing.</p>

<p>She wrote and tore up a dozen notes before she
would send one. There sat the doctor in his easy-chair,
apparently reading, but with his peculiar faint
smile curling the corners of his lips sufficiently to show
that he appreciated her difficulty. The note when
completed read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Tuesday Evening.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Flossy saw in the binding of a hymn-book at Samoset a
notice of grandmother's wedding. She will tell you about it, if
you will call on her.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Patience Sanford.</span><br />
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have to beg your pardon for my rudeness this
afternoon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The effect of this note was to bring the lawyer to
the cottage the next morning. As mischievous fortune
chose to have it, Patty was on the piazza, selecting for
pressing the brightest of the scarlet and russet woodbine-leaves
which had been spared by the storm. She
knew his step upon the walk; and, although she would
not turn, she was prepared to meet him with a kindness
which should atone for yesterday's harshness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
But she defeated her own intention. Meaning to be
gracious, she yet was not willing to give the first sign
of abandoning hostilities, expecting her lover to know
instinctively the state of her mind, and to approach
her in a corresponding temper.</p>

<p>The lover's eyes shone with a wistful tenderness as
he regarded the slender figure upon which the bright
leaves fell in showers of gold and green and scarlet.
His relations with Patty troubled him, and yet he
knew not how they might be improved. He knew
women from books rather than from nature, and his
knowledge profited him little in his own dilemma.
The sudden changes in Patty were incomprehensible
to him. He had accepted her apology as a necessary
consequence of the fact that she was a lady: what it
had cost her, or how she had passed from anger to
tenderness, he did not suspect.</p>

<p>She, on her side, interpreted him no better. His
self-restraint she called coldness; and, when he failed
to respond to a softened mood, she felt that her
affection found no response in his heart. This morning
she was unconsciously in a frame of mind which
would render her dissatisfied, whatever his attitude:
had he divined her relenting, she would have thought
him presuming, as now she called him cold. The
only comfort Tom might extract from such a situation
was the fact, hardly likely to occur to him, that she
was a thousand times more displeased with herself
than with him.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," the gentleman said, stepping
upon the piazza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morning," she returned, keeping her face
from him.</p>

<p>"It is a right royal day after the storm," he said,
rather for the sake of saying something than from any
active interest in the weather.</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented laconically.</p>

<p>"How do your theatricals come on?" asked he.</p>

<p>"'As the man went to be hung,&mdash;very slowly,' to
use Will's slang, or figure of speech as Flossy calls it."</p>

<p>"This world," the lawyer said rather irrelevantly,
"is chiefly figures of speech."</p>

<p>"What does that signify?"</p>

<p>"It signifies that you think of our talk yesterday
hyperbolically."</p>

<p>Patty felt herself growing flushed and perturbed.
Their conversation hid completely the sentiments
underlying it. Her tenderness was met by apparent
indifference. What was this talk of figures of speech,
when he should have said simply "I love you."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," she replied, "I do not think of
our conversation yesterday at all."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you so resolutely keep your face
from me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not because I said any thing yesterday
that I am ashamed of."</p>

<p>Putnam took from his pocket her note, and read
aloud the postscript.</p>

<p>"It is very generous in you to fling that in my face,"
she exclaimed, turning suddenly.</p>

<p>"It was abominable," he laughed; "but it made
you show your face, and that's worth sinning for."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you keep my note?" she asked, as he
carefully replaced it in his pocket-book. "You told
me once you never kept any letters but business ones."</p>

<p>"Oh! I always preserve yours. Every rule has
its exception."</p>

<p>"I am flattered," she said, softening a little.</p>

<p>"You've no reason to be," he retorted saucily. "I
only keep them because I suppose you are sure to
demand them some time; and, if I couldn't return
them, you'd say I kept them."</p>

<p>"Then, I demand them now."</p>

<p>"You shall have them when you give me mine."</p>

<p>"You may have them this minute," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ah!" retorted he, laughing. "I have discovered
what I wanted to know. You have cared enough for
them to keep them."</p>

<p>"You are the most hateful man on the face of the
earth!" she said angrily, running into the house, and
up to her own chamber.</p>

<p>She gathered all his notes together, with the trifles
she had treasured, even before she confessed to herself
that she cared for him,&mdash;this odd stone from
Mackerel Cove, that Chinese coin he took from his
watch-guard one day as a reward for a joke she made,
a dry and musty cracker upon which he drew at a
picnic a clever caricature of Mrs. Brown's frowsy head,
a few dried flowers, and a pencil-sketch or two. She
gathered them together, meaning to make a packet of
them to put into Tom's hands before he left the house.
Then she began to read over the notes, simple things
that said little, and from another would have had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
especial meaning or value. Here he asked her if he
might drive her to a picnic at Wilk's Run; this was
to say that he was going to Boston, and would be glad
to execute any commissions for her,&mdash;trifling things,
but written by his hand. She turned over his gifts,
keepsakes which any friend might give to another.
She recalled, while making up her packet, the circumstances
in which each came to her. Memories exhale
from mementos as odors from faded roses laid long
away among our treasures. Patty ended by a brief
shower of tears, and by replacing the souvenirs in the
box whence they came. Her tears cleared her mental
atmosphere as a thunder-shower may the air of a sultry
day. Ten minutes later she flashed down stairs, bright,
trenchant, and gay as a dragon-fly. She comforted
herself with the illogical conclusion, "After all, I love
him so deeply, he must love me."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lawyer had questioned Flossy. She
described so bewilderingly the situation of "this pew,
you know," that it was quite impossible to form the
slightest idea of its position. He therefore concluded
to take the young lady herself to Samoset; and, just as
Patty descended from her chamber, the two drove
away. The psalmody was found without trouble; and
the printed slip in the binding was eventually traced
to the newspaper from which it was cut, furnishing the
link which had before been missing in the evidence
needed to secure the long-talked-of pension.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXIV." id="ChXXIV.">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<h3>MRS. SANFORD SPEAKS.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There's</span> nobody else," said Will Sanford;
"and if Tom Putnam won't take the part, the
'Faithful Jewess' may go to the 'demnition bowwows'
but her sorrows will never afflict a Montfield
audience."</p>

<p>"Nobody would be more heartily rejoiced, I'm
sure, than I should," his sister answered, "if she
would take a journey in that direction: only there
isn't time to learn another play. So you'll have to
ask him."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask him yourself?" Will said.
"It's your place."</p>

<p>"I'll never ask him to do any thing. He's too
stubborn to live, and he treats me abominably."</p>

<p>"Then, you should heap coals of fire on his head
by inviting him to take this part, that nobody but Sol
Shankland would have anyway."</p>

<p>"When I heap coals of fire," she returned vigorously,
"I want them to burn: I want at least to be
able to smell the scorched hair."</p>

<p>"I think you will have that satisfaction," her brother
replied, "if you'll walk into his office this afternoon,
and tell him there is no one in the three towns can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
act as well as he can, and ask will he please be that
drivelling idiot of a patriarch."</p>

<p>"I'll do nothing of the kind. Besides, I'm going
to ride with Clarence Toxteth this afternoon."</p>

<p>"He's always dangling round you nowadays, it
seems to me."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help that, can I?"</p>

<p>"You could if you wanted to. If you married anybody
for his money, Patty, I'd never speak to you
again."</p>

<p>"Pooh! You'd speak to me if I married a boa-constrictor."</p>

<p>"No. I'd send you a card on which you'd find
nothing but the awful words,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Boa-constrictoress, farewell!</span>'"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Nonsense! You'd come over to be constricted,
and the long and lovely bridegroom could make his
supper of you. You know you adore me, Will, and
so you'll see Tom Putnam. Tell him Sol is sick, or
lame, or dead, or whatever it is, and we can't do without
him."</p>

<p>"I'm always put upon," her brother said with mock
despair: "in fact, I'm but a lovely, timorous flower
that has been snubbed in the bud. I suppose I'll
have to do it."</p>

<p>"That's a duck. You're an awful nice brother!
But then who wouldn't be with such a surpassingly
lovely sister!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Will encountered the lawyer in
the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was going to see you," he said. "You presented
yourself in the nick of time."</p>

<p>"People who present themselves in the nick of
time," Putnam answered good-humoredly, "generally
find themselves in a tight place. What did you want
of me?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you that you are to take the part
of the patriarch in the sensational, melodramatic madness
entitled 'The Faithful Jewess,' to be performed
for the benefit of the church on the 23d of this
blessed month of October."</p>

<p>"You are sure that you are not misinformed?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"But I have already declined to take part in those
theatricals."</p>

<p>"My informant was very positive," Will said.</p>

<p>"May I ask the name of your informant?"</p>

<p>"Patty Sanford."</p>

<p>"Did she say I was to act?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Will answered, distorting the truth with
perfect recklessness.</p>

<p>"Um! The part must have been given to some
one before this."</p>

<p>"Yes. When you refused, there was nobody left to
take it but Sol Shankland."</p>

<p>"What has become of him?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"General inanity, I suspect, though he says, 'neümonyer,'
as he calls it."</p>

<p>"In that case," Putnam said, laughing, "he might
furnish the funds."</p>

<p>"But you'll come to rehearsal to-morrow night?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Sanford asked, fumbling in his pocket for a play-book.
"It's at our house at half-past seven."</p>

<p>"If your sister has issued her commands, I suppose
I've nothing to do but to obey."</p>

<p>The fact was, that the lawyer repented his former
refusal, since it shut him out of the rehearsals at
which Patty necessarily spent most of her evenings;
and he was glad circumstances had put it into his
power to retrieve his error. He found himself daily
longing more and more to be near her, and yet shut
more completely from her presence. He walked on
towards his office with a brisker step, and neglected
his business to commit the senseless lines of the part
assigned to him.</p>

<p>About the time that Will was so unscrupulously
using his sister's name to insnare the lawyer, that
young lady was having a somewhat spicy interview
with her mother. From the day when young Toxteth
had confided to Mrs. Sanford his intentions in regard
to Patty, the shallow woman had gone about with the
secret locked in her bosom like a vase of perfume,
whose subtile odors pervaded every corner of her
brain-chambers. Her head unconsciously took a new
elevation, and her step a fresh dignity. The Sanfords
were independent and comfortable. Dr. Sanford's
practice was good, and rather more lucrative than is
usual in country-towns. With Will's education, however,
and Patty's books and music-teachers to provide
for, the surplus at the end of the year was small; and
Mrs. Sanford never ceased to sigh for the time when,
the son being established in his profession, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
daughter married, her husband could begin to accumulate
property.</p>

<p>"Daughter Britann," grandmother would say, "thy
mind is overmuch set on this world's goods. The
Sanfords are never rich, unless thee shouldst reckon
the wealth of brains; and thou hast already sufficient
for all thy needs."</p>

<p>"So have you, mother," Mrs. Sanford one day
retorted; "but I notice you are just as anxious about
your pension, for all that."</p>

<p>"That I shall bestow in charity," the old lady
answered. "I hope I am not unduly anxious. If
my son Charles had not wished it, I should never have
troubled the matter."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Mrs. Sanford said. "It would have
been a sin to neglect such an opportunity. I am glad
that for once Charles had sense enough to do the
right thing about a money matter. He's usually so
dreadfully squeamish!"</p>

<p>To a mind like Mrs. Sanford, the getting of money
was the only end worth pursuing in this world. Her
fancy dwelt upon the position Patience might occupy
as the wife of a wealthy Toxteth, and upon her own
importance as the mother-in-law of the best catch in
Montfield. Knowing how much Patty might be influenced
by her father, in case she proved blind to her
own good in this important matter, Mrs. Sanford one
night ventured to broach the subject to him.</p>

<p>"It is time Patty was getting settled," she began.</p>

<p>"Humph!" the doctor returned, "I do not see the
need of any haste."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"But there is need. If she lets her chances slip by
now, she'll live to repent of it. Girls who are over
particular always have to put up with a crooked stick
at last."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?"</p>

<p>"Why," Mrs. Sanford said rather hesitatingly, "she
might have Clarence Toxteth, if she only chose."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I do know, and that's enough," his wife answered
importantly. "He's half dead for her."</p>

<p>"He'll be whole dead before he gets her, unless
she's a bigger fool than I ever thought her."</p>

<p>"Now, Charles, that's the way you always talk.
What have you got against Clarence?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't any brains, for one thing."</p>

<p>"He must have," Mrs. Sanford returned, as if her
logic admitted of no controversy. "Just see what a
smart father he's got! What a sight of money Orrin
Toxteth has made!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! His brains stand in the same relation
to his father's as froth does to beer. Good-night. I
want to go to sleep."</p>

<p>"You always were prejudiced against Clarence Toxteth,"
the wife said. But Dr. Sanford allowed this to
be the last word by answering nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford felt that irritation which one feels who
cannot understand how any point of view but one's
own is possible. Not to be foiled, she abandoned the
attempt to convince her husband, only to concentrate
her energies upon her daughter. Very naturally she
attempted to dazzle her eyes with the wealth which so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
bewitched her own fancy. Knowing by experience
the difficulty of dealing abruptly with Patty, she began
by throwing out hints which seemed to her the acme
of strategical tactics, but which were in reality so
transparent, that Flossy and Patty made merry over
them without stint. Of course, this came to nothing;
and Mrs. Sanford would have been the most obtuse of
mortals, had she failed to perceive that she produced
no impression in the suitor's favor. But the doughty
woman had obstinacy, if not firmness; and, the more
her plans did not succeed, the more firmly she clung
to them. She prepared for the attack; and her daughter,
foreseeing what was to come, steeled herself for
the combat.</p>

<p>Patty suffered more from the weakness and prejudices
of her mother than any one but Dr. Sanford himself.
Will, both from his sex and from being much
away from home, treated her oddities rather as witticisms.
In his sister an inborn reverence for family,
and a devotion to the name and relation of a mother,
fought with her perception of the ludicrous, and an
instinctive repugnance to narrowness and mental inferiority.
Shut her eyes as she might, she could not
be blind to her mother's faults; and Mrs. Sanford's
affection, which should have compensated, had always
appeared rather an accident of custom, and but skin-deep.
The silly blunders which the doctor's wife
constantly made, her absurd superstitions, continually
jarred upon her daughter. Patty reproached herself
sharply, her conscience flagellating her with vigorous
arm for discerning these shortcomings of her mother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
but no amount of self-reproach can dull the mental
vision. She attempted to see only her mother's kindly
deeds; but Patty was neither the first nor the last to
discover that reverence and love are not to be constrained
by an illogical balance-sheet; and that the
taking account of stock in affection generally indicates
a tendency to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford had remained in suspense as long as
she was able to endure it; and, upon the morning referred
to earlier in this chapter, she at last spoke definitely.
She was a little in awe of her daughter, having
more than once been confused and worsted by that
young lady's quickness of thought and expression;
and the "Sanford will," she knew of old, had a strength
against which it was useless to contend, if it were once
determinedly fixed.</p>

<p>"Patty," she said, as they chanced to be alone together,
"didn't I hear you tell Willie you were going
to ride with Clarence Toxteth this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. We are going to Samoset to look at
those costumes."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it. You haven't treated him very
well lately."</p>

<p>"You are losing a hairpin, mother."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Your father's thinking of me, I suppose."</p>

<p>"It ought to please you to have your husband think
of you."</p>

<p>"He needn't think all the hairpins out of my head,
though," responded Mrs. Sanford. "I'm always losing
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where does the sewing-circle meet next week?"
Patty asked, endeavoring to lead the conversation as
far as possible from its original theme.</p>

<p>"At Mrs. Brown's; though I doubt she won't be
ready for it until a week after it's all over. I declare,
I thank the Lord I ain't so shiftless!"</p>

<p>"Well you may," Patty said lightly, feeling safe
now.</p>

<p>"He'll be the richest man in Montfield," said Mrs.
Sanford, returning to the charge with an abruptness
which found the other off her guard.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" her daughter asked absently.</p>

<p>"What of that!" the mother cried impatiently. "A
good deal of that. But I suppose you'd refuse him,
if he offered himself to-day."</p>

<p>"Of course, mother. You know I'm never going
to marry."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like a fool, Patience. If you know
when you're well off, you'll be careful how you snub
Clarence Toxteth."</p>

<p>"I treat him as I do everybody else."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't. You must treat him different.
Oh, dear!" Mrs. Sanford continued, quivering with
excitement and indignation. "The trouble that girls
are from the day they are born! Always contrary, and
never knowing what they want, nor what's best for them.
Why girls can't be born boys is more than I know!"</p>

<p>"There, mother, that is Irish enough for old Paddy
Shaunessey."</p>

<p>"Always flying in the face of luck too," her mother
went on, not heeding the interruption, "and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
taking up with some crooked stick at last. The way
you run after that old Tom Putnam is shameful!"</p>

<p>It perhaps made little difference what Mrs. Sanford
said in an argument of this kind, except that a reference
to Mr. Putnam was the most infelicitous thing it
were possible for her to utter. Patty had self-control
enough not to speak the angry words which were on
her tongue; but she hastened from the room, leaving
her mother to reflect as she chose upon the results of
the interview.</p>

the presence of her mother, his suit would have been
disposed of in the most summary manner. It has
been somewhere remarked, however, that women are
creatures of changeable minds. By the time afternoon
and the Toxteth equipage had arrived, the
maiden's heart had so far relented, that she greeted
her suitor as kindly as ever. As she rolled along in
the luxurious carriage, her nimble fancy busied itself
in picturing the future as it might be, if she chose to
accept the man by her side. The very keenness of
the senses, the fineness of perception which she possessed,
made ready avenues by which temptations
might enter. With tastes which demanded luxury,
with at once the love and the knowledge of beauty,
it was hard to deny herself the wealth which would
put these things within her reach. To one who had
been long the acknowledged leader among her associates,
there was, too, a peculiar temptation to accept
the hand of the wealthiest man in the village, making
a brilliant match, and securing her position for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
future. The weakness of Patty's nature that afternoon
asserted itself; and all the way to Samoset she
was rather silent, following in her mind a brilliant
will-o'-the-wisp, which shone and glistened indeed,
but led over dangerous morasses.</p>

<p>In the errand in relation to the costumes, the young
people found themselves unexpectedly delayed; so
that the short October twilight was already falling
when they drove out of Samoset. By the time Wilk's
Run was reached, it was so dark, that, in the shadow
of the carriage-top, their faces were not visible to each
other. As the gloom deepened, the courage of the
young man increased; and when at length he could
not see the eyes of his companion, he was able to
speak the words which had all the afternoon been
jostling each other in eagerness to obtain utterance.
Unabashed with all others, Clarence found in Patty's
clear glances a penetration against the embarrassment
of which he strove in vain; but, that removed, he
spoke.</p>

<p>"It may seem strange for me to say it," he began;
"but I've quite made up my mind that we should get
along nicely together."</p>

<p>"Have you?" she returned, laughing, but secretly
uneasy. "We have never quarrelled, that I remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he answered, "of course not. I hope
you don't think so meanly of me as to believe I'd
quarrel with you."</p>

<p>"No," she said, smiling to herself; "but I might
have quarrelled with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," said he. "But we get on so
nicely together, that, I say, why shouldn't we be
always together, you know?"</p>

<p>He could hardly have chosen a more unfortunate
phrase in which to couch his proposal. There came
over his companion a sickening sense of what it would
be to live always with the man at her side. He
attempted to embrace her with the arm not occupied
with the reins; but she shrank back into the farthest
corner of the carriage, filled with the bitterest self-contempt
because she listened to him. This self-reproach
was his salvation. The sense of her own
weakness in letting him declare his passion, and of
her dishonesty in keeping a silence which he might
interpret favorably, so overwhelmed her with detestation
for herself, that by contrast she for the moment
almost regarded Clarence as an injured angel of
honesty and devotion. From this odd mingling of
feelings arose a sort of pity for her suitor; and, although
she answered nothing, she suffered him to
say on.</p>

<p>"I love you," he continued, "and I should be a
fool if I didn't know that I have something to offer
the girl who marries me."</p>

<p>"If I ever married," Patty answered in a constrained
voice, "I shouldn't marry for what a man
could give me."</p>

<p>"If that is true," she added to herself, "why am
I listening to him at all? Oh, what a hypocrite I
am!"</p>

<p>"Of course not," Toxteth said, answering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
remark he heard. "But a man is no worse for having
a few dollars, is he?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Then, why do you not say that you will marry
me?" he demanded almost petulantly.</p>

<p>"I was not aware that you had asked me."</p>

<p>"I have, then. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," she said. "I cannot tell. Don't
ask me to say more now."</p>

<p>"I must say," he retorted, rather offended, "that
I can't be very much flattered by the way you
talk."</p>

<p>"But you know how dreadfully sudden"&mdash;</p>

<p>The lie stuck in her throat, and refused to be
uttered.</p>

<p>"Is it? How blind you must have been! Couldn't
you see all summer that I was smashed?"</p>

<p>Patty was conscious of a wild desire to strangle
her lover, and then fling herself under the wheels
of the carriage. She longed to get possession of the
whip, and lash the gray span into a gallop.</p>

<p>"I am fearfully cold and hungry," she said, feigning
a shiver. "Do drive faster."</p>

<p>Clarence was ill pleased with the result of his
wooing; yet the fact that he had not been absolutely
refused made it needful for him to restrain his impatience.
He whipped up his horses, and the carriage
bowled along the road in a way that at another
time would have filled Patty with delight. As it was,
she was conscious of a passing thought that it lay in
her power to become the mistress of this dashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
equipage, and with the thought came fresh self-condemnation.
At her gate she was only coldly civil to
Clarence, who drove away, and relieved his feelings by
swearing at his horses.</p>

<p>Patty ran up the path to the cottage like a hunted
deer. She wanted to get away from Toxteth, to escape
as far as possible from the sound of his voice, from the
touch of his hand. On the piazza she encountered
Tom Putnam, who had been calling at the house.</p>

<p>"How late you are!" he said, taking both her hands
in his. "How you tremble! Do you think it prudent
to ride in so thin wraps? We have all been worrying
about you."</p>

<p>"Let me go!" she exclaimed, snatching her hands
from his grasp, and half beside herself with shame and
self-loathing. "Let me go! I hate you!"</p>

<p>And she darted into the house.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXVI." id="ChXXVI.">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<h3>MULLEN HOUSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is hardly to be wondered at that the sleep of
Tom Putnam was not of the soundest that night.
He recalled with painful minuteness the details of his
relations with Patience, reviewing every word, every
look, every gesture, from the evening of the thunder-storm
until her passionate exclamation as she encountered
him upon the piazza. It was not strange that he
did not understand how that fierce declaration of hatred
arose from love. When Patty suddenly found herself
face to face with her lover, a sudden inner gleam, as
with a lightning's flash, showed her clearly her own
heart. With swift and terrible distinctness she saw
how deep and strong was her love for him, and the
miserable way in which she had been paltering with
her own happiness and truth. With this came an
equally rapid revulsion of feeling. She rebelled against
this man for holding her heart in bondage, for constraining
her love. Most of all she hated her own
weakness; and upon him she wreaked her self-contempt.
Knowing nothing of her mental combat, her
lover could only wonder gloomily how he had deserved
or provoked this bitterness, and in the watches of the
night arraigned himself for a thousand fancied shortcomings
which in love are crimes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>He fell into a troubled sleep towards morning, and
awoke to find the sun staring in at his windows, astonished
to find him so late in bed.</p>

<p>October this year was unusually warm and pleasant;
and when, after breakfast, Mr. Putnam rode over to
Mullen House, whither he had been summoned, he
found the air soft and mild as in August. The place
was a mile and a half from his home, standing a little
out of the village, by itself. The leaves along the way
were falling rapidly from the trees, and the sharp teeth
of the frost had bitten the wild grapes and nightshade
at the roadside. In some moist places the elms still
remained full and green, while the brilliant sumach-clusters
ran like a crimson line along the way.</p>

<p>The crickets chirped merrily like the little old men
they are in the night-time, if the old fairy-tale be true.
The asters and golden-rod flaunted their bright blooms
over the stone walls. The distant hills looked blue
and far.</p>

<p>The house to which the lawyer had been summoned
was as singular as it was pretentious. In the lifetime
of its builder it had been vulgarly dubbed "Mullen's
Lunacy,"&mdash;a name not quite forgotten yet. It was of
stone, chiefly granite, although in a sort of tower which
had been built later than the rest, the material used
was a species of conglomerate. The building apparently
had been modelled somewhat inexactly after some
old English manor-house, and was a very noticeable
object in a straggling modern village like Montfield.
Mr. Mullen, its builder, had inherited, with a large
property, a studious disposition, and a will as remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
for its firmness as for its eccentricity. He had
given his life to study, which came to nothing as far as
the world was concerned, since it resulted in no productiveness.
He had attained a high degree of scholarly
culture, but manifested it chiefly in ways fairly
enough regarded by his acquaintances and neighbors
as affectations. He wore the dress of the Englishman
of letters fifty years before his day,&mdash;an anachronism
less striking then than now, it is true, but significantly
symbolical of his habit of looking to the past rather
than the present or future for mental nourishment.
His mansion was furnished largely with antique furniture
obtained in Europe, and was always associated, in
the mind of Patty and Will Sanford, with the mediæval
romances they had pored over in the old library in
childhood. The Sanfords were among the very few
Montfielders who were admitted at Mullen House,
as the proprietor chose to style his dwelling, upon
any thing like terms of equality. The doctor's family-tree
struck its roots deeper into the past than did that
upon which the eccentric scholar prided himself; and
the two families had been friends for generations.
The children had been made welcome to the childless
mansion; and, when Ease Apthorpe came home to her
grandfather's house, she found the brother and sister
already almost as much domesticated there as at home.
After the death of Mr. Mullen, the visits of the young
people were less frequent; but the close friendship
formed with Ease had never been loosened.</p>

<p>Mr. Mullen's youth had vanished early; but he had
remained single until well towards middle life. Scandal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
had made free with his name in connection with
Mrs. Smithers, both before and after he had married a
timid wife, whom, after the fashion of Browning's Duke,
he expected</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To sit thus, stand thus, see and be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the proper place, in the proper minute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And die away the life between."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A sweet woman, who lived again in her grand-daughter
Ease, was Mrs. Mullen,&mdash;a flower requiring
sunshine and love, and who was as surely chilled to
death by the frosty smiles of her husband as the four-o'clocks
by the rime of autumn. Dying she left him
two children,&mdash;Tabitha, the eldest, "a little faithful
copy of her sire;" and Agnes, quite as true to the
mother-type. Tabitha the father had kept at home,
and educated himself. She grew up so like him, that
she almost seemed an image into which had been
breathed his spirit.</p>

<p>Tabitha Mullen was a woman of stately presence,
with keen black eyes, and hair which had been like
a raven's wing until time began to whiten it. She
dressed always richly, wearing sumptuous apparel,
rather because it was in keeping with her state as the
only remaining representative of her name, than as if
impelled thereto by any womanly vanity. She ruled
her household with a rod of iron; and, from the boy
who drove the cows afield, to the stately butler, the
servants all stood in awe of her. This butler had once
been a great scandal to the worthy people of Montfield;
and even time had done little to change their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
feelings. He was one of Mr. Mullen's English innovations;
and besides this objection, and the outrage
of being a man-servant for indoor service, the butler
was, in the minds of the village people, connected with
the very questionable inversion of the natural order
of things caused by five-o'clock dinners, and the still
more outrageous habit of having wine at that meal.
Miss Tabitha drank wine at dinner, and had it served
by a butler in livery, because her father had done so
before her. That Montfielders were shocked was a
matter for which she cared no more than she did
what missionary the King of Borrioboola-Gha ate for
his breakfast. The absurdity of attempting to keep
up the state of an old English mansion in a New-England
village was a matter which the mistress of
Mullen House did not choose to see; and that to
which she chose to be blind she would not have
perceived if illuminated by the concentrated light
of a burning universe. So Mullen House and its
mistress, its life and its state, existed in strange
anachronism in the midst of the work-a-day world
of Montfield.</p>

<p>Not an easy woman to live with was Tabitha Mullen,
as her niece had found. Agnes Mullen, the younger
daughter, had been reared by the sister of her mother;
had married a young music-teacher with no fortune
save the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He held of his lute in fee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Very happy had they been together, and perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
for that reason, had held but loosely to life, departing
nearly together, as they believed to a better existence,
soon after the birth of little Ease.</p>

<p>The orphan had grown up, snowdrop like, in the
gloomy state of Mullen House,&mdash;a slender, graceful
maiden, gentle and shy. Of yielding disposition, the
Mullen strength of will had somehow been tempered
in her to a firmness of principle. Hers was one of
those natures which hold to what they believe true
and pure with the same despairing clasp a drowning
man fastens upon a floating spar, clinging with the
strength of one who struggles for very existence.
Desiring to yield every thing asked of her, she found
the approval of conscience a necessity,&mdash;a character
to make life in adverse circumstances hard but high,
bitter but pure.</p>

<p>In some respects Ease's surroundings were fortunate
for her peculiar disposition. The Episcopal form
of worship which Miss Tabitha affected as most nearly
like the Church of England was particularly suited to
the needs of her niece, since it gave color and richness
to a faith otherwise too sombre. The young girl's
companionship with the Sanfords also had been of a
nature calculated to brighten her life.</p>

<p>The relation between Ease and Will Sanford had
never been quite the same as before since that Sunday
afternoon at Wilk's Run. The young man felt no
longer towards Ease as a dear friend simply. The
presence of a rival had awakened in his heart the
passion which had long lain there dormant. Love
ceased to be a dream coldly ideal, and sprang up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
living fire. He was conscious now of a keen delight
in Ease's presence, very different from the negative
pleasure her companionship had hitherto afforded him.
The touch of her hand, the brushing of her dress
against him, suddenly became events to be watched
for and remembered.</p>

<p>This changed very little their outward demeanor,
save that they might have seemed to an observer to
have become somewhat reserved toward each other.
The smallest chances had suddenly assumed too great
an importance to be lightly indulged in. A virgin
shyness enveloped Ease, which Will had not yet dared
break through by the caresses he longed to bestow.</p>

<p>But all this has little to do, directly at least, with
the visit of Tom Putnam to Mullen House. He had
been not a little surprised by the summons, since no
very cordial feeling existed between himself and Miss
Mullen; and he had speculated, as he drove along,
upon the possible nature of the business involved.
His surprise was not lessened, when, after the slightest
exchange of civilities compatible with very scant hospitality,
Miss Tabitha suddenly came at once to the
point by an abrupt question.</p>

<p>"Why," she asked, "have you brought that Smithers
woman into the neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Brought her into the neighborhood?" he echoed
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, brought her into the neighborhood. She is
living in your stone cottage at this moment. If you
haven't any care for my feelings, you might have
considered your own reputation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"My reputation!" he repeated, puzzled. "What
has that to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Shankland and Mrs. Sanford
could tell you," she retorted with a scornful
smile.</p>

<p>He was silent. Wrongly, it is true, but with the
weight of a certainty, it flashed upon him that here was
the key to Patty's sudden hatred. He turned sick at
the thought of the gossip she must have heard; then,
with a quick throb of pride, he raised his head in wonder
that the woman he loved could believe this of him.
He rose at once, and stepped towards the door.</p>

<p>"If you had hinted at your business," he said, "it
would have saved my coming over. Whatever cause
you may have to be sensitive in regard to Mrs. Smithers,
I certainly have none; and you will allow, I think,
that the stone cottage belongs to me."</p>

<p>Nor could Miss Mullen's persuasions move him.
The thrust she had given his pride, thinking thereby
the more surely to accomplish her object, had turned
against her. He felt that to send away the woman
who had become his tenant would appear an acknowledgment
of the truth of the slander against him.</p>

<p>But it was with a heavy heart that he rode homewards.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXVII." id="ChXXVII.">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE RUSTIC ROAD.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Flora Sturtevant</span> was walking
slowly along a lovely forest-road. It was
near sunset, and the rays of light shot long bars of
dusky gold between the tree-trunks. The robin, the
thrush, and the oriole, still delaying through the warm
autumnal weather, sang by starts amid the branches.
The bright knots of ribbon upon Flora's dress, and the
scarlet poppies in her hat, were touched and lighted by
the glow, making all the hundred lights and gleams of
the wood seem to centre about her figure. She carried
in her hand a bunch of ferns and grasses, mingled with
a few bright leaves; and she sauntered with the careless
air of having come out merely for enjoyment.</p>

<p>The road had once been the county turnpike, but
had long ago fallen into disuse. Now the trees met
overhead, the grass and ferns had obliterated the
marks of wheels, and, except for hunters or loitering
pleasure-seekers, the way remained untrodden.</p>

<p>But Miss Sturtevant, idle and leisurely as was her
mien, was not simply sauntering to enjoy the pleasure
of nature. She was upon a diplomatic errand. Frank
Breck had conducted her hither, and had turned back,
that she might be alone to encounter a man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Breck knew was soon to pass this way. The lady was
perfectly cool and collected. The idea of meeting in
the forest a man to whom she had never spoken, and
whose character she knew to be bad, seemed not to
give her the slightest concern. Perhaps she expected
Breck to remain within call; possibly her strong self-reliance
made her insensible to fear.</p>

<p>At length the barking of a dog rang through the
woods, and soon sounds of some one approaching
were heard. Miss Sturtevant's lips closed with an
expression of firmness, over which, however, instantly
spread the veil of a smile. Shading her eyes with her
hand, and half-turning where she stood, she looked off
through the leafy spaces towards the setting sun, conscious
that the first glimpse the new-comer caught of
her would give him her figure at its best. So absorbed
was she in gazing at the sunset, that she apparently did
not hear the approaching stranger until he was within
half a dozen feet of her. Then she turned suddenly,
just as the dog ran up to her. She uttered a little
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>"How you startled me!" she said, stooping to
caress the dog, a handsome pointer. "What a lovely
dog you are!"</p>

<p>"He is a kind o' handsome pup," the hunter said,
replying to the remark addressed to his dog,&mdash;"handsome
for a pup, that is," he added guardedly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Flora, catching sight of the game
which the man carried. "Oh, how perfectly lovely
the necks of those birds are! What are they? What
a fine shot you must be!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, middlin'," he answered, evidently flattered.
"Them partridges was terrible shy."</p>

<p>"I've wanted a heron all summer," remarked she,
still admiring the glossy necks of the birds. "The
feathers, I mean; but I didn't know anybody who
could shoot one."</p>

<p>"Herons ain't none too plenty round here," he said,
"and it's all-fired hard to get a shot at one."</p>

<p>"Haven't I seen you before?" asked Flora, letting
her trimly-gloved hand rest upon the dog's head.
"Did you ever live in Boston?"</p>

<p>"I guess I did!" he returned. "I lived with Breck
there for most seven years."</p>

<p>"Oh! then, you are Mr. Mixon. It is wonderful that
I happened to meet you here. I've wanted to see
you for a long time. Do you know who I am?"</p>

<p>"You must be Miss Sturtevant, ain't you?&mdash;the
one who was so deused smart about the Branch
stock."</p>

<p>"Did you hear of that?" she asked, laughing. "I
suppose I am the one; but I didn't know I was so
smart."</p>

<p>"All-fired smart is what I say," Mixon affirmed
with emphasis. "What did you want of me?"</p>

<p>"You may think it strange," she said reflectively;
"yes, I'm sure you will think it very strange that I
know any thing about it; but you have some papers
that I want to see."</p>

<p>Mixon's face instantly assumed an expression of
intensest cunning. He leaned upon his gun, bending
his head towards his companion. The dog stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
between the strangely-matched pair, turning his intelligent
face from one to the other. Flora pushed her
hat back from her face as if for coolness, but in reality
because she knew it was more becoming so. Her
blue eyes shot persuasive glances upon the man before
her; while her fingers toyed with the long silken ears
of the pointer.</p>

<p>"Papers!" Mixon said. "What sort of papers?"</p>

<p>"Papers that old Mr. Mullen"&mdash;She left her sentence
unfinished, not wishing to risk displaying her
ignorance of the real nature of the documents in question.
Mixon regarded her sharply.</p>

<p>"Do you know Frank Breck?" he asked. "Maybe,
now, he might ha' mentioned this to you."</p>

<p>"I know a great many people besides Frank Breck,"
she returned, smiling. "I didn't need to go to him
for information."</p>

<p>"It's mighty strange," Peter said in a deliberative
way, "how many folks thinks I have papers they want.
There's Breck; he's always at me. And Miss Mullen&mdash;she's
sent for me a sight more times than I've been.
And then Hannah Clemens, she thought I might have
something would put her into her rights. Then there
was Tabitha Mullen's lawyer"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Wentworth?" questioned Flora eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's him. He mittened on to me the other
day."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know he had been here."</p>

<p>"He only came down one train," said Peter; "an'
he went back on the next. Miss Mullen sent after me
to see him. And now you take it up, and want some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
valuable papers. I wish I could supply you all; but
I can't."</p>

<p>"But you can at least let me see"&mdash;Flora began.
But Mixon interrupted.</p>

<p>"I can't let you see what I hain't got, can I?
Somebody must ha' lost an awful precious dociment
to make all this stir.&mdash;Come, Trip."</p>

<p>"Honestly," Miss Sturtevant said, in her fear that
he would escape her, going so far as to lay her fingers
upon his arm,&mdash;"honestly, haven't you those
papers?"</p>

<p>"Naturally I wouldn't want to speak too positively,"
he returned coolly, "not knowing what you want.
But I guess it's safe enough to say no.&mdash;Come, Trip."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Flora, retaining the hold she had taken
upon Mixon's coat-sleeve. "I didn't mean to put
you to trouble without paying you for it."</p>

<p>"Well, that's business. How much, now, should
you say was a fair sum, if I had the papers, and would
let you see 'em?"</p>

<p>"You might make your own terms," she said quickly,
more and more convinced of the value of the mysterious
papers. "You'd be the best judge of what it
was worth."</p>

<p>"Well, that's generous, almost too all-fired generous.
I'm sorry I can't accommodate you; but I can't.
Good-night, marm."</p>

<p>And, followed by Trip, Mixon strode off down the
rustic way, already dusky in the fast deepening twilight.</p>

<h3>THE THEATRICALS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> mixed audience filled to overflowing the
town-hall of Montfield. In the front-seats,
which had been cleverly reserved for them by a small
advance in price, were seated the <i>élite</i> of the village,
complacently chatting together of the weather, the exhibition,
their servants, and such small gossip as serves
to savor the somewhat insipid existence of a country
village. Behind these sat the farmers with their wives
and daughters; the former regarding the curtain with
a species of awe, while the latter indulged in clumsy
flirtations with the rustic swains, who offered them delicate
attentions in the shape of lozenges and peanuts.
The talk here among the elders was chiefly of the
crops and of cattle; while the youths and maidens
speculated, giggling, upon the prospects of a dancing-school
for the winter.</p>

<p>The relatives of the performers were chiefly in the
reserved seats, and exhibited more or less nervousness
according to their temperaments; all alike, however,
endeavoring the most preternatural semblance of indifference.</p>

<p>"I have half regretted," Miss Tabitha Mullen
remarked to Dr. Sanford, next whom she chanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to be seated, "that I allowed Ease to take part in
this. It scarcely seems the thing with such a mixed
audience. But all her associates were concerned in
it, and I did not wish to seem over particular."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be too strict with Ease," Mrs. Sanford
began to reply for her husband, when the tinkling of
a bell announced the rise of the curtain, and she left
her remark unfinished.</p>

<p>The young people of Montfield were accustomed
at intervals to give theatrical performances, finding
this the easiest method of raising funds for charitable
purposes. They had accumulated quite a respectable
collection of scenery and stage-properties, all more or
less primitive, but answering sufficiently well for their
purposes. "The Faithful Jewess" required chiefly
forest scenery; and of this they possessed quite a
variety, amateur talent being apt to run to the rustic
drama. The tragedy proceeded smoothly enough,
the back-seats understanding little of it, but liking it
rather better on that account, besides being amused
by the costumes and the high-sounding blank verse.
Mr. Putnam was certainly not an accomplished actor;
but of a part like that of the patriarch he made as
much as the character would admit. The scenes
between himself and Patty were really impressive,
and won the admiration even of Miss Mullen, who
prided herself upon her taste, and was nothing unless
critical.</p>

<p>It is probable that both actors played the better for
the presence of a deep feeling towards each other.
The lawyer was conscious of a thrill whenever his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
hand touched hers; and, if Patience was less moved, it
was because she was more truly an actor, and more
completely identified with her part.</p>

<p>At the later rehearsals the young lady had ignored
the presence of any misunderstanding between herself
and her lover, and had been outwardly her usual
self, bright and gay. She had avoided any approach
to sentiment, alike with Toxteth and with Putnam.
She had given herself up to the arrangements for the
exhibition, attending to those thousand details of which
no one else ever thought. She enjoyed the excitement,
and that most seductive of all forms of flattery,
the self-consciousness of being a motive-power and a
leader. She had put aside every thing else to be
thought of and met after this evening; and the feverish
excitement arising from this undercurrent of feeling
buoyed her up to-night.</p>

<p>Her dress, setting off her fine form to advantage,
was in color and arrangement admirably adapted to
her beauty, and never had she looked so superbly
handsome. No wonder that to-night her lovers were
more deeply enamoured than ever.</p>

<p>Among her lovers, be it said here, was no longer to
be numbered Burleigh Blood. The transfer of his
allegiance to Flossy Plant, which Patty had first attempted
in half-jest, had become deep earnest; and
the giant was the humble slave of the little lady he
might almost have balanced upon his extended palm.</p>

<p>"The Faithful Jewess," with its "ring-round-rosy"
situations, its harrowing dialogue, and long-winded
soliloquies, at last reached its tragic climax. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
actors strung themselves before the curtain in answer
to the vigorous applause of hands horny with holding
the plough, and then retired to the dressing-rooms to
prepare for "The Country Wooing." The Montfield
orchestra, under the lead of old Gustave Harlakenden,
the German shoemaker, plunged precipitately into the
mazes of a wonderful <i>pot-pourri</i> of popular melodies;
while the audience rustled and buzzed.</p>

<p>Tom Putnam, who was not in the cast for the second
play, having resumed his ordinary clothing, emerged
from his dressing-room just as Miss Sturtevant came
from hers, costumed for "The Country Wooing."</p>

<p>"I must congratulate you," she said, "upon the
decided hit you made in 'The Jewess.' You took
the house by storm."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Tom. "You attribute to
me the honor which was due to the ladies in the
piece."</p>

<p>"It is very modest of you to say so," Flora smiled;
"but you undervalue your own acting. I wonder if
you will think me rude and presuming, if I make a
request."</p>

<p>"Ladies are supposed never to be either," he answered.</p>

<p>"How satirical! I am afraid to ask you. But I
will. Will it be too much to ask you to walk home
with me to-night? I go to-morrow, and I want you to
take those books I borrowed. I should have returned
them before."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will," replied he. "I did not know
you went so soon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"I waited for these theatricals," she said. "My
half-sister is to be married next week, and I ought to
have gone before."</p>

<p>They had by this time reached the end of the stage,
which served as a sort of green-room. Here direst
confusion reigned. Burleigh Blood had made the
dreadful announcement that the excitement had driven
his part entirely out of his mind.</p>

<p>A dozen voices proffered in consternation several
dozen suggestions at once.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Flossy said. "Make up something:
nobody will know."</p>

<p>"But the cues?" exclaimed Miss Sturtevant in
dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish I were at home!" cried Dessie
Farnum, almost in tears.</p>

<p>"I never could make up any thing," Burleigh said
in despair. "I was a fool to take the part anyway!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to trust to the prompter," Patty said.
"There's no help for it now. You are not in the first
scene, and can look it over."</p>

<p>"Or hunt up your wits," added Emily Purdy.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" Patty asked. "Ring up."</p>

<p>The bell sounded, bringing the orchestra to so
sudden a stop, that one out of sight might have
supposed an immense extinguisher suddenly clapped
over it.</p>

<p>"Don't bother," Flossy said consolingly to Burleigh
as he stood in the wing, vainly endeavoring to follow
the advice of Patty. "If you forget, I'll prompt you.
I know the whole of your part and mine too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Had he known that few mortals were more liable to
stage-fright than Flossy herself, he might have been
less comforted: as it was, he placed implicit confidence
in her ability, and this gave him sufficient self-control
to fix for a little his attention upon his book. The
next moment, in some way, without any exact knowledge
of how he got there, he found himself upon the
stage, and the other players one by one going away,
and leaving him in the full gaze of that sea of faces.
He longed to catch them and hold them back, as each
slipped into the friendly obscurity of the wings; but
he stood stiff and helpless alone upon the stage with
Flossy. The scene which ensued was as follows, the
italics indicating what was said in a tone inaudible to
the audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flossy</span> (as Waitstill Eastman). "Won't you sit
down, Jonathan? <i>You say I don't mind if I do.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burleigh</span> (as Jonathan Cowboy). "You say I&mdash;I
don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>F. "Why don't you then? <i>I'm goin' to.</i>"</p>

<p>B. "I'm goin' to."</p>

<p>F. "<i>Don't hold your arms so stiff!</i> So is Christmas
coming. You needn't, though, if you don't want
to. (Sits.) I mean to make myself comfortable. <i>I
was waiting for you to sit down.</i>"</p>

<p>B. "<i>For me to sit down?</i>"</p>

<p>F. "<i>Say that!</i>"</p>

<p>B. "For me to sit down."</p>

<p>F. "<i>Sit down!</i>"</p>

<p>B. "Sit"&mdash;</p>

<p>F. "<i>Goodness! Don't say that!</i> Your chair don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
seem easy, somehow. Maybe the floor ain't even over
there. <i>I'll move it over there, then.</i>"</p>

<p>B. "I'll move it, then."</p>

<p>F. "<i>Move nearer to me.</i> Don't come any nearer
me!"</p>

<p>B. "<i>Which shall I do?</i>"</p>

<p>F. "<i>Move up!</i> You'd better keep your distance!
<i>Move up! Yes, miss.</i>"</p>

<p>B. "Yes, miss."</p>

<p>F. "<i>Keep moving nearer.</i> Now get out, Jack
Cowboy! <i>Now don't</i>"&mdash;</p>

<p>B. "<i>I know it.</i> Now don't be cross, Waitstill. It
ain't often a feller has a chance to come and see you."</p>

<p>And, having thus got fairly launched, Burleigh recalled
his lines, which he had faithfully committed, and
went smoothly on to the end. Flossy had occasionally
to direct his actions, for he fixed his attention so
firmly upon the words, that his tendency was to repeat
them like a parrot; but between them they came
through safe. And, as Flossy had once jokingly predicted,
her friend's awkwardness passed for clever acting,
so that his success was so great as to astonish
every one, particularly himself.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXIX." id="ChXXIX.">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<h3>NIGHT-SCENES.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Sturtevant's</span> summer visit to Montfield
usually ended with September, but this
year she had remained for the theatricals. That she
did not carry Tom Putnam's heart as a trophy of her
summer's campaign was certainly no fault of hers. As
she walked home from the exhibition, leaning upon his
arm, she taxed him with his want of attention.</p>

<p>"I have scarcely seen you for the summer," she
said. "You have been very sparing of your calls."</p>

<p>"I confess my remissness, but I have so little
time."</p>

<p>"You might at least," Flora said, "have come to
thank me for my hint about the Samoset and Brookfield.
Almost everybody else sold out."</p>

<p>"To your gain," he returned. He had little respect
for the woman beside him, and was annoyed at her
intrusion.</p>

<p>"I thought I answered your note," he continued.
"I certainly intended doing so."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did!" Miss Sturtevant said, leaning upon
his arm more heavily. "But a note is a poor substitute
for a call from one to whom one is attached."</p>

<p>"I hope," the lawyer observed briskly, determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
not to be drawn into a scene, "that you have sold out.
I see by the morning paper that the vote has been
reconsidered, and the Branch is not to be bought, after
all: I suspected it would be so, all the time. The
whole thing was only the work of speculators, and I
hope you were as lucky as I in getting rid of your
paper at the flood."</p>

<p>"What!" cried his companion,&mdash;"reconsidered?
You do not mean that the Branch isn't to be bought?
Uncle Jacob promised"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Branch certainly is not to be bought," Putnam
repeated. "The corporation has no use for it,
and never had. You haven't held your stock?"</p>

<p>"I have," she answered, pressing her thin lips together.
"I am completely beggared. Good-night. I
must have time to think."</p>

<p>"I wish I had known," Tom said, standing upon
the step below her; for they had reached the Browns'
door. "I supposed you knew all about the stock."</p>

<p>"I thought I did," she answered in a strained, thin
voice. "It seems I was mistaken. Good-night."</p>

<p>She went in, and the door closed behind her. Tom
walked home, kicking his boot-toes out against every
pebble, divided between disapproval and pity.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later Miss Sturtevant was confronted
with Mr. Jacob Wentworth in the library of his
Beacon-street residence. The lawyer sat by a grate
in which had been kindled a fire as a precaution
against the autumnal chill in the air. On a small table
at his hand lay the last number of "Punch," between a
decanter of choice sherry and a well-furnished cigar-stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Mr. Wentworth's family being out for the
evening, he was enjoying himself in almost bachelor
comfort, only the contrasting background of bachelor
loneliness being needed to make his happiness complete.
He was not well pleased at this late call from
Flora, of whom he had never been fond, and who now
came to mar the delightful ease of his evening with
complaints of the inevitable. She looked worn and
old and eager. She had been travelling a large part
of the day, and the anxiety which Putnam's news had
brought to her had told severely.</p>

<p>"I knew you would reproach me," Mr. Wentworth
was saying. "But, when I found that you had deceived
me, I felt under no further obligations to you."</p>

<p>"But I did not deceive you. Peter Mixon has the
papers."</p>

<p>"I took the trouble to go to Montfield myself," the
other answered judicially, "to prevent the possibility
of a mistake; for the Mullen property is a large one,
and my client's interests are my own. I saw the man
personally, and he assured me that he had no papers
whatever."</p>

<p>"So he did me," Flora burst out; "but I was not
such a fool as to believe him."</p>

<p>The lawyer gave a sweeping wave of the hand as if
to thrust completely aside the implication.</p>

<p>"You are imaginative," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"I had proof of it," she returned,&mdash;"proof, I tell
you; and you have lied to me about the Branch, and
ruined me."</p>

<p>She was ashy pale, and even Mrs. Gilfether would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
have found no lack of expression in her blue eyes
now.</p>

<p>"The turning of the road the other way," Wentworth
said unmoved, "was for my interest; and, when
Miss Mullen assured me that Frank Breck had the
papers, I hardly felt under obligation to communicate
further with you."</p>

<p>"Frank Breck?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He is the son of an old friend of the
Clemens woman."</p>

<p>"Uncle Jacob," Miss Sturtevant said in her harshest
voice, rising from her seat as she spoke, "you are a
fool. I shall be even with you yet. Good-night."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When, on the night of the theatricals, Patty saw Tom
Putnam give his arm to Miss Sturtevant, she accepted
at once the proffered escort of Clarence Toxteth. To
Toxteth's remarks she replied in monosyllables, pleading
that she was very tired. She dismissed him at the
piazza-steps, and, passing into the shadow, gave him
the impression that she had entered the house. As a
matter of fact she discovered her door-key to be missing;
and, not caring to disturb any one, she sat down
to wait for Will. He was long in coming, for he and
Ease loitered that night.</p>

<p>But steps approached; and, to her surprise, Patty saw
in the moonlight Bathalina and her quondam husband
coming up the walk. They parted midway between
the gate and house, Mrs. Mixon advancing alone.</p>

<p>"I thought, Bathalina," Patty said, "that you had
given that man up."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Law, Miss Patty, how you started me! I thought
you would have been a ghost."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Where have you been all this time?"</p>

<p>"Traipsin' up and down, up and down, like the
Devil, seeking of somebody to devour. I'm worn
almost out of my shoes, but Peter would argufy it out.
So we've been traipsin' up and down; and this shawl's
so thick, and the weather so warm, let alone it's bein'
October and ought to be cool, that I am about melted
to death."</p>

<p>"What makes you wear your shawl, then?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a young girl, miss, that I should walk in
my figger. I won't go through the streets with my
figger showin', if it kills me."</p>

<p>"What are you walking with Peter Mixon for, anyway?
I thought you were done with him."</p>

<p>"Well, miss," the servant answered with a great
appearance of candor, "Amanda West wouldn't have
him, seein' as he was sort of married to me; and I've
been thinking very likely it was all my sinful pride
refusing to live with him after the Lord had kind o'
jined us."</p>

<p>"The Lord kind o' joined you, I should think!"
Patty retorted contemptuously. "The Old Evil One
had more to do with it."</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXX." id="ChXXX.">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>

<h3>THE WOUNDS OF A FRIEND.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> plan which Mrs. Toxteth had once mentioned
to Ease, of having a masquerade follow the exhibition,
had not been forgotten; and the invitations had
accordingly been issued. It was arranged that the
actors should meet on the morning following the theatricals,
and make some arrangement for the exchange
of costumes. About ten o'clock Patty, Flossy, and
Will walked over to the Hall together.</p>

<p>"I feel like the ashes of yesterday's cigar slopped
with the dregs of last night's champagne," yawned
Will, with some reminiscence of wicked college frolics.</p>

<p>"And I," Flossy said, "feel like this man, you know,
that"&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I don't know," he interrupted. "I never
know 'this man,' Floss; but I'm sorry you feel like
him."</p>

<p>"If you'd kept still, you might have found out who
he was; but now you'll never know."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell us!"</p>

<p>"No, I shall not. 'Twasn't that other, you know,
either."</p>

<p>Flossy's "this man," or "that other, you know,"
were as famous in her particular circle as Sairy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Gamp's "Mrs. Harris, my dear," in a more general
one. These allusions were seldom intelligible, and
it is to be suspected that sometimes the little witch
made them purposely obscure for her own amusement.</p>

<p>The company assembled in the Hall was rather a
sleepy one, with scarcely energy enough for discussion.
The talk naturally ran chiefly upon the performance,
the various haps and mishaps, the successes and
failures, the money obtained. Patty and Tom Putnam
chanced to stand near each other, and a little apart
from the others. She had taken a slight cold from
her exposure upon the piazza the night before, and was
coughing.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry you've taken cold," the lawyer
said.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she returned.</p>

<p>"But every time you cough," he said with mock-pathos,
"one of my heart-strings snaps."</p>

<p>"I should think they'd be about all used up by this
time, then."</p>

<p>"Oh! I tie them up again, after the fashion of guitar-strings."</p>

<p>"But a tied-up string cannot give a good sound."</p>

<p>"No," he laughed, "only a kind of melancholy
'bong.' But one gets accustomed to any thing."</p>

<p>"It is a pity," she said, "that these mortal frames
cannot be made with less rigging. Think how much
simpler it would be to grow like a crystal, without all
'the bother of all the fixin's inside on us,' as Bathalina
says."</p>

<p>"But a crystal must have a rather cold existence,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
he returned. "I prefer our present condition, thank
you."</p>

<p>"Patty Sanford," called Dessie Farnam, "do come
and tell us how to distribute these costumes!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," Patience answered, "that the
simplest way is to lay all the dresses out in one of the
rooms, and draw lots for choice. Then each person
can go and choose, and nobody be the wiser."</p>

<p>"I think that is best," Clarence Toxteth assented.
"I wonder we didn't think of it. You remember our
bet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" Patty replied. "I am as sure of those
gloves as if I had them now."</p>

<p>Toxteth had somewhere seen or heard of the
fashion of betting gloves; and the custom seemed to
him the acme of high-bred gallantry. He had accordingly
bet with Patty that he should be able to penetrate
her disguise at the masquerade. She was determined
to win this wager, and had already settled in
her mind the costume she should, if possible, secure.</p>

<p>Some time was occupied in laying out the dresses,
and then the lots were drawn from a hat. The first
choice fell to Patty, and the second to Emily Purdy;
Ease had the third, and Putnam the fourth.</p>

<p>"Now we shall see what we shall see," Patty said
gayly. "I'm going to try on all the suits, and take
the most becoming."</p>

<p>She disappeared into the dressing-room, and after a
few moments emerged empty-handed.</p>

<p>"Where is your dress?" Emily Purdy asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"I put it into my trunk," was the reply. "It is all
ready to take home that way."</p>

<p>Miss Purdy was absent far longer than Patience had
been; but a large bundle in her arms furnished a ready
excuse for the delay.</p>

<p>"If everybody is as long as this," Will said, "we
that are at the bottom of the list had best go home,
and come over to-morrow. I'm the fifteenth."</p>

<p>"I'm two worse than that," Burleigh Blood declared.
"And between us, Will, there isn't a suit there I can
get into, but my own."</p>

<p>"Take any one," was the reply, "and then get up
any thing you choose."</p>

<p>Putnam stood alone by a window when Emily Purdy
returned, and she advanced towards him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said in a confidential whisper, "how do
you suppose Patty could take Clarence Toxteth's
suit?"</p>

<p>"So you've spent your time discovering what she
chose," he said aloud. "That was as kind of you as
it was honorable."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help noticing, could I?" she stammered,
abashed.</p>

<p>"No, probably not," he answered with quiet scorn.</p>

<p>"Of course I shouldn't tell anybody," she continued.
"But it was so strange of her!"</p>

<p>"She took it as a blind, I presume," he said, "and
means to make a new costume. Excuse me. It is
my turn."</p>

<p>With much laughter and fun the selection continued
until all the dresses had been taken. Burleigh Blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
confided to Flossy, that, when his turn came, the only
male costume remaining was that of little Tim Bawlin,
and that he had taken it.</p>

<p>"What on earth will you do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I must get up something, but I am sure I don't
know what."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to help you," she said. "If I can,
that is."</p>

<p>"Of course you can," he replied. "I shall depend
upon you."</p>

<p>As Patty left the hall, she was joined by the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I am going to see your grandmother," he said.
"This famous pension business is about settled, and I
wish to tell her."</p>

<p>"I am glad if it has at last come to something,"
she returned. "I doubted if it ever would."</p>

<p>"I want to ask a favor of you," he said as they
gained the street.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I had the misfortune," he said slowly, "to be
forced to take for myself the dress Dessie Farnum
wore last night. It is evident enough that I cannot
wear it, and I want to change for the one you have."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"As I say."</p>

<p>"How do you know what dress I have?"</p>

<p>"What does that signify, since I do know?"</p>

<p>"It signifies a great deal. I never thought you so
dishonorable as to play the spy."</p>

<p>"Do you think me so now?"</p>

<p>"What else can I think?" she demanded hotly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"As you please: let the insult pass," he said.
"The main thing is that you exchange with me."</p>

<p>"I will not exchange with you!"</p>

<p>"You will not?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But, Patty, just consider the talk and the scandal
it will make if you wear a man's dress, to say nothing
of the indelicacy."</p>

<p>"Indelicacy! Thanks! We are quits on the score
of insults."</p>

<p>The costume Patty had chosen was an old-fashioned
dress-suit, with knee-breeches and swallow-tailed coat.
In selecting it, she had only considered how perfectly
it would answer as a disguise, and had acted upon the
impulse of the moment.</p>

<p>"It was not like a public mask," she had said to herself,
"but a small party of intimate friends." The words
of the lawyer set the matter in wholly a new light
before her. She tried to feel that all her anger was
against him, but was secretly conscious of the imprudence
of the thing she had planned to do. The fact
that he was right, and yet wrong by not considering
the innocence of her intentions, incensed the girl the
more.</p>

<p>"I do not see that you have the right to be my
mentor in any case," she exclaimed. "But nothing
seems to make you so happy as to see me miserable.
Why must you be prying about to discover what
dress I mean to wear at all? One would expect you
to be sufficiently ashamed of that to keep from betraying
yourself. But no: you cannot let slip an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of correcting me, even at the expense of smirching
yourself. Oh, and this is the love you professed
for me!"</p>

<p>"Patty," he said quietly, as she paused to choke
back the sobs which strangled her, "will you be kind
enough to tell me what all this is about?"</p>

<p>"About? As if you did not"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," he interrupted. "I was not done.
Is it, then, proof of a want of love that I hurt myself
to save you from a foolish thing you will not be willing
to do when you come to think of it, and of which you
would be ashamed if you did it thoughtlessly?"</p>

<p>"Hurt yourself!" she returned scornfully. "It may
hurt you: I do not know. But you cannot wonder if I
find it a little hard to believe. But you do not seem
to consider whether it hurts me, or not."</p>

<p>"Why should it hurt you to do me a favor, and
exchange costumes?"</p>

<p>"The fact that you know what costume I have hurts
me. I do not enjoy finding I have been deceived in
my friends."</p>

<p>"The faith you have in your friends cannot be very
robust to be so easily shaken."</p>

<p>"Thank you again. I am unfortunately accustomed
to believe my senses."</p>

<p>"As you please," he said coldly, holding open the
gate for her to enter. "But you have not answered
my question."</p>

<p>"What question?"</p>

<p>"Will you do me the favor of exchanging dresses
with me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have answered that."</p>

<p>"But you must reconsider."</p>

<p>"Must!" she flashed out,&mdash;"must! You have no
right to say <i>must</i> to me, thank Heaven! and you never
will have!"</p>

<p>"You will say it to yourself in this case," he said,
pale and self-contained.</p>

<p>"If I do, I shall not need your interference."</p>

<p>She turned her back upon him, and walked between
the leafless shrubs towards the house, setting her heels
determinedly upon the walk. It was not until she had
entered the door that she remembered his errand to
her grandmother; and by that time he had taken the
path across the orchard to his home.</p>

<p>"I have done it now," he muttered to himself.
"The society of women will make a fool of the most
sensible of men. But what an ass I was to set to work
so clumsily! I wish Emily Purdy were in Tophet!"</p>

<h3>AUNT JEFF REMONSTRATES.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">If</span> it makes you feel bad to have me cross," Patty
said one morning, in answer to a remonstrance
of Flossy's, "think how much worse it is for me to be
cross. I have to endure my own company all the time,
you know."</p>

<p>"Well, Patty-pat," Flossy answered meditatively,
"be happy and you'll be virtuous. And that reminds
me of Bathalina's room. Don't you think that when
it's papered&mdash;aunt Britann, didn't you say it was to
be done this week?&mdash;it might have a frieze, or a dado,
or something, of mottoes?"</p>

<p>"Of mottoes?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've thought up some lovely ones. 'A woman
is known by the company she forsakes' is a good
one. Then, 'The early bird dreads the fire,'&mdash;you
know how she hates to get up and build the fire."</p>

<p>"Water is more her element," said Will. "Can't
you have&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Bonnet and feather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She'll wash together!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or something of that kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! That isn't good. 'Be virtuous and you'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
be disagreeable' might do; and 'Marry in haste, and
separate at leisure.' I'll think up plenty of mottoes,
aunt Britann, if you'll have them put on her
walls."</p>

<p>"There comes her aunt Thomas Jefferson Gooch,
at your service," Will said, glancing from the window.
"There must be a storm in the air to bring her over
so early."</p>

<p>He was right. Mrs. Gooch had come over to remonstrate
with her niece upon her relations to her
husband.</p>

<p>"I couldn't rest, Bathalina," she said, "after hearing
that that unfacalized critter was round here again,
for I knew just what a fool you be. And it ain't no way
respectable to have an intermittent husband, always
comin' an' goin,' like the old woman's soap. 'Tain't
what our folks has been used to. He's got all your
money, hain't he? I'm sure I don't see what more
he wants. You let him have every copper you had in
the bank, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"Well," retorted Mrs. Mixon, "what if I did? I
put that money by for a rainy day, didn't I? an' when
it come, I spent it."</p>

<p>"Lawful sakes! I hope you didn't put it by for
Peter Mixin's rainy days! As I told your cousin
Huldy, he's one of them folks that makes a dreadful
cheerful funeral."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Bathalina, in her confusion
wetting her finger, and putting it to the water in the
boiler to see if it were hot enough to sizzle, like a hot
iron. "How confusin' you are, aunt Jeff! '<i>Restless</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mortals toil for nought,' as the hymn says; and you're
one of 'em."</p>

<p>"I should think I was!" retorted aunty Jeff. "But
I tell you ours is a respectable family, and such culch
as Peter Mixup was never brought into it before; to
say nothing of having a husband bobbing after you
like the tail of a kite, now here and now there!"</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed her niece fiercely. "How
you go on! Don't get me mad, or my sinful pride'll
be too much for me."</p>

<p>"Sinful fiddlesticks! If you had any pride, you
wouldn't have that rag-tag-and-bobtail, Tom-Dick-and-Harry
sort of a husband round you!"</p>

<p>"I shall go mad!" cried Bathalina, with an awful
shrillness in her tones. "You'll make me go a raving
lunacy!"</p>

<p>"You are one now!" screamed her aunt. "You
always was."</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Bathalina seized the rolling-pin,
and began to roll the pie-crust she was making with a
vigor which bespoke the conflict within. At the same
time she burst out into her favorite song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tortured in body, and condemned in spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sweet composure'"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I always hide the rolling-pin from <i>my</i> pastry,"
broke in aunt Jeff with cutting emphasis. "Pie-crust
is like millinery, the less it is handled, the better."</p>

<p>"Sinful sakes!" exclaimed her niece, throwing
down the rolling-pin. "I try to live as I'll wish I had
when I stand round my dying-bed; but if you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
here to fight, we'll just make a business of that, and
let other things go. But if you come peaceable, you
just keep your tongue still."</p>

<p>"Well, well," the visitor said, somewhat startled,
"we won't quarrel. But what is Peter Mixer dangling
round here for?"</p>

<p>"Something or other between him and Frank
Breck," Bathalina said evasively. "I never asked him;
for I found I couldn't get it out of him, though I've
tried more'n forty different ways."</p>

<p>"But what's he taking up with you again for?"</p>

<p>"Me?" demanded the other indignantly. "Ain't
I his wife? Besides, he says Hannah wants to make
up with me, and leave me her property."</p>

<p>"Her property! Where'd she get any?"</p>

<p>"Well," Bathalina answered with an air of profound
mystery, which in reality arose from profound ignorance,
"Hannah may not have been all she ought to
be, an' I ain't sayin' she has. But she may have property
for all that. And, since her daughter ran off with
that Brown of Samoset, Hannah's set agin her, and
Peter's talked her over to consider me. And if she
does,&mdash;as why shouldn't she?&mdash;if she does"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" interrupted aunty Jeff sardonically.
"Ef she does! Ef is a crooked letter. And I
thought our family was done with that Hannah Clemens,
or Smithers, or whatever she calls herself. I'm
sure I cast her off the day she went off with old
Mullen."</p>

<p>With which conclusion she gathered herself together,
and departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>On the afternoon of this same day Burleigh Blood
came to take council with Flossy about his masquerade
dress. In Montfield the young people were
thrown upon their own resources for costumes to be
used in theatricals or fancy-dress parties. Burleigh,
motherless from boyhood, and having no sisters, was
forced to take Miss Plant at her word, and come to
her for aid on this occasion, being, if the truth were
told, but too glad to do so. The brawny fellow, with
his magnificent chest and his deep voice, was as ardently
in love with this sallow morsel of humanity as
if she had been as like Brunhilde as he like Siegfried.
Her odd ways and harmless affectations were to him
inexpressibly droll and charming. He had at first
been thrown into her society by the caprice of Patty,
who amused herself by playing upon the diffidence of
her suitor. It was not long before Patty began to suspect
that this clear-eyed giant had somehow touched
her cousin's heart, which proved large enough to contain
him, despite her tiny person. Visions of matchmaking
danced rainbow-like before the eyes of Patty,
and she contrived that her quondam lover and her
cousin should constantly be thrown together; or, more
exactly, she fancied she managed what would in any
case have come about. Later her own affairs had engrossed
her so completely, that she hardly even noticed
how matters stood with Flossy.</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know what to wear," Burleigh
said, when he and Flossy were alone together in Mrs.
Sanford's parlor. "It is such a bother to get up a
rig!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've thought it all out," Flossy answered. "You
wear this long frock, you know, and it will disguise
your figure, and oh! monks do have such good things
to eat! This will do finely, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Her friend had not the least idea of her meaning,
and only stared.</p>

<p>"It could be made of black cambric," Flossy continued;
"and I'll lend you a rosary, and you'll want
an old rope to gird it in. You'll make a magnificent
monk."</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean me to dress as a monk."</p>

<p>"Of course. Didn't I say so? Sometimes folks
don't understand me, but I'm sure I don't see why.
Of course I can't help that."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," he assented. "But how shall
I get this robe?"</p>

<p>"Bring me the cloth, and I'll make it. Grandmother
will help me."</p>

<p>"It is too bad for you to have so much trouble."</p>

<p>"Pooh! It's no bother. I'm sure I shall be glad
to do it; and, besides, I shall know you."</p>

<p>"That's so!" he said. "What are you going to
wear?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd tell?"</p>

<p>"It is only fair you should, for you'll know me.
Besides, I can never find out anybody."</p>

<p>"Well," Flossy said in a sudden burst of confidence,
"I'll tell you something. Ease and Will&mdash;no,
I won't tell that, for I promised not to, and you
mustn't mention it if I did. But I'm going to wear
the dress Ease wore in 'The Country Wooing.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was it red?"</p>

<p>"Red? No, indeed! You never know any thing
about what a girl has on."</p>

<p>"I know I don't. I don't look at them enough."</p>

<p>"More likely," she retorted, "you look at the wearers,
and not at the dresses."</p>

<p>"No: only at you."</p>

<p>Let no reader suppose Burleigh was complimenting:
he was only telling the simple truth. Flossy blushed a
little at his earnest frankness.</p>

<p>"You'd better look at Patty," she said. "She's
ever so much prettier."</p>

<p>"I suppose she must be," he responded <i>naïvely</i>;
"but I'd rather look at you. I hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Oh, not in the least! Why should I? But this is
all wool-gathering. Let's arrange about your suit."</p>

<p>"But you haven't told me what your dress is."</p>

<p>"It's a white lute-string."</p>

<p>"Lute-string?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," she said, laughing at his puzzled
face. "This old-fashioned soft silk."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought lute-string"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would be like a guitar-string, I suppose; but it
isn't. Don't you remember the dress? It had a square
corsage"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'd better not tell me any more. It's an old-fashioned
soft silk, and it's white. That is all I could
remember. I shouldn't know a square corsage from&mdash;from
a square handspike."</p>

<p>The friendship between Flossy and Burleigh ripened
rapidly over that monk's garb. She assumed great airs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of superiority and authority over him, which pleased
Burleigh marvellously. She climbed into a chair to fit
the robe over his shoulders, boxing his ears when he
insisted upon turning around that he might see her;
being at last forced to compromise by letting him face
the mirror, and gaze rapturously at the image of her
<i>petite</i> person and pale face. But at last Flossy got so
embarrassed, that she declared she must at once be
satisfied about the weather, and led him off to consult
Mrs. Sanford.</p>

<p>"Of course it will be pleasant next Tuesday evening,"
Mrs. Sanford decided after a consultation with
her beloved "Old Farmer's Almanac." "The moon
quarters in the west at seven o'clock that very night.
I wish," she continued with a sigh, as she returned
the almanac to its place, "that we didn't have to
change almanacs every year. I just get all my accounts
down in one, and its year's gone by. And then
I'd like to keep an almanac for association's sake; but
I suppose it wouldn't be much good the second year.
Things do pass away so in this world!"</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXII." id="ChXXXII.">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>

<h3>HEADS AND TAILS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of the masquerade came, and a more
sombre mortal than was Patience Sanford the
sun did not shine upon. The resolve to wear the costume
she had chosen cost her many a bitter pang.
She endeavored to persuade herself that self-respect
required this assertion of her independence of control,
yet by this very decision it sank like the mercury upon
a winter's night. She said to herself, that, had Tom
requested her not to wear the dress, she would gladly
have yielded; but that his assumption of deliberate
indelicacy on her part, and his overbearing way of correcting
her, were insolences not to be endured. There
was little meekness about Patty's love. As yet it was
a flame that scorched rather than warmed. But she
was as true as steel, and the fire within would in time
work to her finer tempering.</p>

<p>Riding with her father the morning of this day,
Patty saw Peter Mixon accompany Tom Putnam into
the office of the latter; and she fell to wondering
deeply what could be the occasion of so strange a
companionship. Had she entered with them unperceived,
she might have heard the following conversation:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is up between you and Frank?" the lawyer
asked. "You are together a good deal. What sort
of a hold have you on him?"</p>

<p>"Hold on him?" echoed the other. "I hain't got
no hold on him. We've been gunning together some.
He got kind o' used to me when he was a little feller.
He always had more sconce than Hazard. Hazard's
too almighty good for me. I like a feller's got some
devil in him."</p>

<p>"I think likely," Putnam answered. "What is your
hold on him?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I hain't got none."</p>

<p>"You may as well carry your lies somewhere else,"
the lawyer said coolly. "They are wasted on
me."</p>

<p>"You was always d&mdash;d hard on me," Mixon said
after a moment of sullen silence. "You don't take
no account o' your family's spoilin' me. I was straight
as a Christian before Breck got hold o' me. 'Tain't no
fair twittin' on facts gener'ly; but you don't seem to
remember that I know your brother-in-law wrote your
name once, an' there warn't never nothin' done about
it."</p>

<p>"Now you speak of it," returned the other unmoved,
"I remember that Peter Mixon witnessed it. It seems
to me rather longer than it is broad; for Breck is dead,
and Mixon is living."</p>

<p>"But Breck's family ain't dead. You won't bedaub
them in a hurry, I'm thinkin'; and you can't touch
me 'thout you do them."</p>

<p>"We talked this all over when Breck died," Putnam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
said. "It will hardly pay to go over it again now. I
want to know just what you and Frank are at."</p>

<p>"'Tain't nothin' that concerns you," the man said,
sullenly yielding. "'Tain't nothin' but a paper his
father gave me to keep, and he wants it."</p>

<p>"To keep for whom?"</p>

<p>"To keep for&mdash;for myself of course. 'Tain't at
all likely he'd give me a paper for any one else."</p>

<p>"No, it is not," the lawyer remarked impartially;
"and that is why I think you stole it."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you!" began Mixon, "I'm no more of a
thief than Breck was. I'll"&mdash;</p>

<p>"There," Putnam interrupted, "that will do. Keep
still, and let me see this paper, whatever it is."</p>

<p>"I hain't got it with me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Let me see it."</p>

<p>"I hain't got it here, I tell yer. You never take no
stock in nothin' I say, seems to me."</p>

<p>"That's true. What is this paper? and how came
you by it?"</p>

<p>"He give it to me the night before he died. That
old maid Mullen wanted to get it, but Breck he give it
to me. 'You've always been a faithful frien' to me,'
says he, 'an' you shall have it.' An' then he give it
to me."</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at him with mingled amusement
and disgust. Perfectly aware that the man was lying,
he tried to decide upon what slight foundation of fact
had been built this touching death-bed fiction. In his
own mind Putnam connected this mysterious paper
with the anxiety of his nephew Frank to force Ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Apthorpe to marry him, the mention of Miss Mullen's
name giving to this some plausibility. Suddenly a new
thought flashed through his mind.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Smithers mixed up in this business?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Mixon, evidently startled, denied this so strongly,
that his questioner was positive he had hit the truth,
and insisted upon seeing the mysterious document.
Peter stuck to his assertion that he did not have it with
him, but at length promised to bring it on the following
day for Putnam's inspection. And with this the
lawyer was forced to content himself.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of this same day a pleasant little
scene was enacted in the chamber of Burleigh Blood,
that young man being at once actor and audience.</p>

<p>He had been trying on the dress he was to wear that
evening, and his thoughts naturally turned from the
robe to its maker. In his fancy rose a picture of the
little maiden seated by his own fireside, or flitting
about the house as its mistress. He felt his bosom
glow, thinking how dear to him would be the traces of
her presence, the sound of her voice. His heart grew
warm with sweet languors at the dream of clasping her
in his arms, of resting that tiny blonde head upon his
breast. There is something inexpressibly touching in
the love of a strong, pure man. Burleigh neither analyzed
nor understood his own passion; but in manly,
noble fashion, he loved Flossy with all the strength of
his big heart.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Burleigh mused, "if she would be
angry if I asked her to marry me; or if she'd have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
me. She'd be a fool if she did! she knows so much,
and is so used to great people! I suppose it is no use
to bother my head for what I can't have. But I want
her; and she's been very good to me; and perhaps&mdash;perhaps
she wouldn't really say no. I'm a fool to lose
the chance by being afraid to speak! Confound it! a
woman's no right to be angry with a fellow for being
in love with her. He can't help it, I suppose. I'm
sure I can't. Besides I've heard her say she'd like to
live in Montfield all her life."</p>

<p>He had thrown himself half-dressed upon the bed,
his monkish masquerade costume hanging over a chair
near by. Turning and twisting about uneasily as the
conflict in his mind became more and more earnest,
the silver-pieces loose in his pocket rattled out, one
rolling from the bed to the floor. He raised himself,
and picked it up. It was a Mexican dollar, dated the
year of his birth, and he had for years carried it as a
pocket-piece.</p>

<p>"I have half a mind," he soliloquized, tossing the
coin in his hand, "to offer myself this very night. I
don't think it would be so hard with this suit on as it
would in my own clothes. It would be more natural
to do any thing extraordinary in a mask. I've a mind
to toss up for it. That is one way of settling it. It
might go against me, though. However, it won't be any
harm to see what it would have been if I <i>had</i> tried it."</p>

<p>The coin went spinning into the air.</p>

<p>"Heads!" he called aloud. "Humph!" he commented
inwardly, "It's tails. But of course I should
have tried the best two in three. Heads! And heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
it is, by thunder! That's one and one. Heads!
Confound it, it's tails again. But then that was only
to try what might have been. Here goes in earnest.
Heads!"</p>

<p>The dollar struck upon the edge of the bed, and
Burleigh cried out "Bar that!" then, picking it up,
found the head uppermost.</p>

<p>"Why didn't I let that go?" he said. "Heads!"</p>

<p>The coin spun round and round gayly. When at
last it lay still, the reverse stared the lover in the face.</p>

<p>"Plague take that dollar! it is always tails. I'll
change it, and begin again. Heads now!"</p>

<p>The new coin proved no less perverse than the old
one, and turned its back toward the young man quite
as resolutely as its predecessor.</p>

<p>"Well, then, here goes,&mdash;tails! By the great horn
spoon, heads it is! I'll make it the best three in five.
Tails!"</p>

<p>But neither the "best three in five" nor the "best
four in seven" gave any thing of hope or comfort to
the lovelorn swain. He ended by dashing the coins together
between his palms with a great clash, all the combativeness
in him aroused by the perverseness of fate.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I don't propose this very night,"
he said resolutely. "I'll not be beaten out of that by
all the unlucky lucky-pennies between here and Africa.
She can't do any more than refuse me, and I certainly
never'll get her if I don't try."</p>

<p>With which notable resolve burning in his heart, he
adjusted his toilet, and descended to the work-a-day
world.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXIII." id="ChXXXIII.">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<h3>"WHEN SHE WILL, SHE WILL."</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Patty</span> was the last to come down from dressing
that night. She had refused to share with any
one the secret of her costume; and even Flossy was
ignorant, that beneath the long cloak which completely
enveloped her cousin was concealed male attire. She
supposed Patty had discarded entirely the suits used
in the theatricals, and had manufactured one. And
indeed she had seen signs of dress-making in her
cousin's chamber; Patty's resolution having at one
time so faltered, that she had begun a page's costume,
which by its short skirt compromised between propriety
and the dress she had chosen. A bundle from Putnam
containing the dress he wished her to wear had been
sufficient to strengthen her faltering courage; and in
full masculine array, knee-breeches and all, Mistress
Patience started for the masquerade.</p>

<p>Very pretty and jaunty she looked in the dress, her
fine form displayed to the best advantage; but under
the embroidered waistcoat and velvet frock beat a very
miserable heart, as sad as it was proud. She smarted
under what she received as a slur upon her modesty.
Conscious of the innocence with which she had chosen
the costume, she assumed that the lawyer had impugned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
her delicacy, when in truth he had merely
reproved her thoughtlessness. In carrying out her
original intent, and refusing to consider her resolve
unmaidenly, she fancied herself protesting and demonstrating
the whiteness of her thought; not recognizing,
that, on the contrary, she was championing the act
itself, of which, in a calmer mood, she would have
herself disapproved.</p>

<p>Light streamed from all the windows of the Toxteth
mansion, brightening up the sear lawn and leafless
trees with a warm glow. Sounds of laughter and
snatches of music were already heard, as the Sanfords
were rather late in arriving.</p>

<p>"Let us separate," Patty suggested. "I'll stand in
the shadow of the piazza a moment, and go in with
somebody else. People will be less likely to know
us."</p>

<p>"Very well," Will said; and then, as Flossy stepped
across the piazza, he added, "What is the trouble with
you, Pit-pat? You've been glum as a ghost all day,
and now your tone is awfully lugubrious."</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing," she answered. "Go in quick,
before these folks come. You are good to care, but
really nothing is the matter."</p>

<p>A group of maskers came up the path as she dismissed
her brother with this well-intentioned fib, and
with them she entered. Familiar with the house, she
slipped past the dressing-room, and went into a sort of
recess at the head of the back-stairway. Here in the
dark she adjusted her dress as well as she was able,
and then seated herself upon her cloak, holding her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
head in her hands. She dreaded going down to encounter
the lights, and the eyes of the company. She
shrank from possible discovery, and lingered until the
fear of having to enter the parlors alone drove her
from her hiding-place. She saw a lady emerging
from the dressing-room, and with a swaggering bow
Patty offered her arm. The lady, taking it, murmured
"Thanks." By the voice Patty recognized Dessie
Farnum. The two descended the stairs together.</p>

<p>They found Mrs. Toxteth receiving at the parlor-door.
Near her stood a mask whom Patience did not
recognize. He was tall and slender, with a figure
which his motions seemed to indicate supple and well
knit. His dress, which was admirably adapted to display
his figure, was that of a Florentine courtier of
Lorenzo de' Medici's day. Patty recalled Clarence's
speaking of friends from Samoset who were to be present,
and set the unknown down as one of the party.
As she moved away, however, she felt a touch on her
shoulder. She started violently, but by a strong effort
endeavored to regain her composure. She felt that at
any cost she must preserve her <i>incognito</i>; and, resolutely
steadying herself, she turned to see who had arrested
her. It was the Florentine chevalier. Taking
her hand in one of his, with the finger of the other he
traced upon her palm the letters "P. S." She shook
her head; but, as she did so, it flashed upon her that
the unknown was Tom Putnam. She had not considered
that it would be necessary for him to procure a
dress in place of the one he had taken to exchange
with her; and now, in despite her agitation, she concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
that he must have sent to Boston for the costume
he wore, and she admired him in it. Her next
thought was that he must have been waiting for her.
She refused the arm which he proffered, but followed
as he led the way into a small back-parlor which
chanced to be empty. There he stood looking at her
without speaking.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, when she had endured the silence
as long as she could. "What has my Lord Mentor to
say now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he answered. "The Chevalier Sorrowful
might present a petition, but certainly my Lord
Mentor is silent."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that at least. Still I should like to
be informed if the Chevalier Sorrowful has ever had
dealings with Paul Pry."</p>

<p>"The Chevalier," the other said, parrying her thrust,
"needs no dealings with Paul Pry. He has eyes for
but one lady, and her he can detect under any disguise."</p>

<p>"What keenness of vision!" Patty retorted. Then,
hoping to give the conversation a less personal character,
she added, "Hark! Who is that singing?"</p>

<p>A voice affecting the Scotch accent was appealing
more frantically than tunefully to "Douglas, Douglas,
tender and true."</p>

<p>"It is Miss Yamfert from Samoset," the lawyer said.
"She is dressed in Scotch costume."</p>

<p>The voice sang on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Could you come back to me, Douglas, Douglas,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the old likeness that I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I would be so kind and faithful, Douglas,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Douglas, Douglas, tender and true!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Very pretty," Putnam remarked rather savagely.
"But, if Douglas is comfortable where he is, he'd much
better remain there. If she really loved him, she
would have shown it while he was in the flesh. I've
no faith in a love which expends itself only in tormenting
its object."</p>

<p>"How harsh you are!" Patty said. "Doesn't your
scheme of life allow any space for repentance?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I've the smallest possible faith in it. If
she hadn't love enough for Douglas to treat him
decently, he was better off with no love at all. No
doubt she would think herself sincere in making frantic
promises over his grave; but, if he were back, it
would be the same dreary story over again."</p>

<p>"Then Douglas had better leave her, and have
done," Patty answered.</p>

<p>She felt, that, under the guise of allusions, they were
discussing their own relations.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said. "But suppose he cannot
choose? What if he be so bound up in her, that he
would endure any thing, would forgive any thing?"</p>

<p>"Forgiveness," she retorted bitterly, "is sweet to
the forgiver."</p>

<p>"It may at least show him his own weakness. If
the lady's love for Douglas is not sufficient to make
her glad of a small sacrifice for him, or at least to
make her endure it, he has small reason to flatter
himself upon the depths of her affection; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
must despise himself for wearing his heart upon his
sleeve for her daws to peck at."</p>

<p>"Well," she said irrelevantly, her heart leaping at
the assurance that after all he still loved her, "who
laughs last laughs best."</p>

<p>"Not always," he returned. "The last laugh may
have a bitterness from which the first was happily
free."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" she laughed, turning a pirouette, her cue
standing out behind her. "How like two owls we
are, talking in this gloomy room! Let us get out
among people."</p>

<p>She had suddenly recovered her spirits. Since he
loved her, she forgot that she was wounding him, and
that he was unhappy. At another time the thought
would have produced tenderness: now it brought a
reaction from her despondency, and for the moment
she was her most piquant, saucy self. She hummed
a snatch of song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'You call me inconstant and fickle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there's no justice in that;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the passing fancy I showed you'"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Patty!" her lover cried, catching her wrist, "are
you perfectly heartless?"</p>

<p>"I shall have a <i>post mortem</i> made to discover," she
returned flippantly. "It will be too late for my own
information, but it will satisfy the curiosity of my
friends."</p>

<p>"If you do not begin soon to cultivate some show,
either of delicacy or sensibility," he said almost brutally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
"your friends will cease to be interested. For
my part," he went on, his voice showing more and
more emotion, "though I can't help being a fool, I
shall try to help amusing you with exhibitions of my
folly. I have never flattered myself that you could
have any particular reason for caring for me; and I
may thank my stars, I suppose, that the question is
settled. But I tell you this, Patience Sanford, you
will go far before you will find a man who will give his
heart for you to set your feet on so absolutely as I
have done. If it is any satisfaction for you to know
that, you are welcome to the knowledge. Perhaps
some time I shall be unselfish enough to hope you may
be happy without me. Just now I have an absurd
fancy that it would be pleasant to strangle you. If
you ever love anybody but yourself, you may know
what that means. Good-night, and good-by."</p>

<p>The cup whose sweet foam Patty had a moment
before set laughing to her lips proved more bitter than
wormwood in its depths. Never had she so thrilled
with passion as while her lover cast her off. Never
before had she seen him so moved. The dress he
wore, setting off as it did his fine figure, gave an appropriate
setting for his words, and by its strangeness half
explained them. Had he remained a moment longer,
Patty felt that she must have thrown herself at his feet,
and begged him to forgive and love her still. As it
was she burst into tears, but in a moment resolutely
suppressed them, and followed her lover into the
crowd of maskers.</p>

<p>Dessie Farnum, having seen that her escort did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
come from the dressing-rooms above, supposed herself
to have been escorted down stairs by Clarence
Toxteth, and as such pointed out her companion.
Several approached Patty, and crossed her palm with a
"T;" but she shook her head, and made her way from
the parlors as quickly as possible. She desired nothing
now but to get out of the house; and, wrapping herself
up, she effected her escape by a side-door, and walked
rapidly away. She removed her mask to let the night-air
cool her heated cheeks and brow; and, struggling
hard to repress the tears which forced themselves into
her eyes, she went on towards home.</p>

<p>Suddenly a clatter broke the stillness of the night,
the noise of wheels and trampling mingled with oaths
and cries. A carriage dashed by her, the horse plunging
forward, evidently beyond the control of the
driver. Another moment, and the vehicle was overturned.
She heard a cry followed by a heavy fall.
The horse rushed madly on, with the carriage half
dragging behind him, the noise of his frantic hoof-beats
dying away in the distance, leaving a stillness
more intense than before.</p>

<p>Patty ran forward, and discovered the lifeless body
of a man lying on the ground.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXIV." id="ChXXXIV.">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE MASKERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the other maskers, if not at
heart happier than Patty, were at least outwardly
gay. The fun was heartily entered into on all
sides, and mock flirtations abounded. Flossy accepted
the proffered arm of an Italian bandit, one of the
Samoset party; and the pair had joined the promenaders
moving up and down the long hall.</p>

<p>"But whom do you represent?" he asked. "I do
not understand your dress."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm Dame Trot and her wonderful cat,"
Flossy returned lightly. "I supposed that even in
Italy I had been heard of."</p>

<p>"So you have, Dame Trot; but, not seeing your cat,
I was naturally puzzled."</p>

<p>"My cat," she replied confidentially, "is dead."</p>

<p>"Indeed? How sad! When did the melancholy
event take place?"</p>

<p>"I do not know exactly. The fact is, he disappeared
one night; and, as I'm sure he couldn't live
without me, I am convinced that he must be dead."</p>

<p>"And you were deprived of even the privilege of
weeping over his grave?"</p>

<p>"He is like Moses," she answered impressively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
"The place of his sepulchre no man knoweth to this
day."</p>

<p>"That is a distinction," laughed the brigand.
"Keep a brave heart, Dame Trot: I may hear tidings
of the wonderful cat yet. Meanwhile here is some
one who is evidently looking for you."</p>

<p>It was a huge monk, who had all the evening been
searching for the white lute-string which she wore.</p>

<p>Some weak souls yield to omens and ill-starred
presages, but heroic mortals overcome them. So far
from being discouraged by the ill-luck of his penny-tossing,
Burleigh was but the more firmly determined
to press his suit. Tucking Flossy under his arm, he
led her out of the press, and found solitude behind
a stand of plants in the back hall.</p>

<p>"I have been trying all the evening to find you," he
said. "Did I not do well to make out the lute-string
dress?"</p>

<p>"Oh, wonderfully!" she answered, imitating him in
pulling off her mask. "Dear me, how hot it is!
These masks are so roasting!"</p>

<p>"They are close," he assented. "Look here," he
continued with sudden vehemence. "I dare say
you'll be angry,&mdash;you'll have a right to be,&mdash;but I
love you, and I want you for my wife!"</p>

<p>"Mercy!" exclaimed Flossy, much as if she had
been shot.</p>

<p>An opening among the plants let a beam of light
fall upon his honest, manly face; and, as he leaned
eagerly towards Flossy, his clear eyes seemed to look
into the very depth of her being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you care for me?" he pleaded. "I have
loved you"&mdash;</p>

<p>He left his sentence incomplete, and caught her into
his arms, to the great detriment of the lute-string
dress. He insisted always that he saw permission in
her face; but she quite as strenuously averred that she
gave him no answer, and that her face could have expressed
nothing but indignant surprise. But in any
case they forgot the world in general and the company
present in particular, until they heard people going
away, and were astonished to find that supper with its
unmasking had passed by, and that it was long after
midnight.</p>

<p>"And I am so fond of supper!" Flossy said. "It
was very unkind of you to keep me here."</p>

<p>"But I am so fond of you," he retorted, "that it
was very good of you to stay."</p>

<p>"I've a great mind to eat you," she said.</p>

<p>"Do. I know I shall like it, and I'm sure I'd taste
better than pop-corn."</p>

<p>"But I haven't promised any thing," Flossy said,
speaking, as usual, quite independently of the subject
in hand. "We're not engaged until you've seen
father."</p>

<p>An hour or two later, when Burleigh was preparing
to retire, his silver lucky-penny dropped to the floor.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" he cried, tossing it into the air. "You
were wrong, after all, old fellow, unless you wanted to
bully me into proposing; and, by George! I think
that's the only way I got pluck for it."</p>

<p>And the great honest fellow took himself to bed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
lay awake thinking of Flossy with a simple humility that
was very touching. A glow of love and happiness
enveloped him like a rosy cloud; and when at last he
fell asleep it was to dreams as passionately pure as had
been his waking thoughts, and, like them, centring
about the little maiden who had that night promised
to become his wife.</p>

<p>Before the guests at Mrs. Toxteth's unmasked, Will
encountered Putnam, and endeavored to discover his
identity.</p>

<p>"You are evidently dumb," he said at last, after having
vainly tried to make Tom speak. "'Tis a virtue
more to be commended in the other sex."</p>

<p>"By great Cæsar's immortal ghost!" exclaimed the
undisguised tones of Clarence Toxteth at his elbow,
"that must be Will Sanford's voice. Where is Patty?
Didn't she come?"</p>

<p>"She came, but I don't know where she is."</p>

<p>"I've hunted the whole evening for her, and have
had supper put off on purpose to find her before we
unmasked. I followed Emily Purdy a while, but I
knew her voice the minute she spoke."</p>

<p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders, but still remained
silent.</p>

<p>"For my part," Sanford said, "I shouldn't tell her
dress if I knew it; but as it happens I don't. She was
covered from head to foot in a waterproof when we
came."</p>

<p>Putnam turned away with a feeling of relief. He
began to hope that Patty's wild freak might pass unknown,
and searched through the rooms, meaning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
make a last appeal to her to leave before the masks
were removed. His search was of course unsuccessful,
but he encountered Emily Purdy.</p>

<p>"How clever Patty Sanford was in deceiving us!" he
said as soon as he was sure she knew him. "We might
have known she only took that man's dress as a blind.
Have you seen her to-night? I think her costume the
handsomest here."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't seen her," Emily answered. "How
is she dressed?"</p>

<p>"You'll see when we unmask," Tom answered;
adding, with quiet sarcasm, "It wouldn't be quite fair
to tell before."</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXV." id="ChXXXV.">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>

<h3>PETER MIXON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Finding</span> a man flung apparently lifeless at her
feet, Patty applied herself in the most matter-of-fact
way to the discovery whether he were dead or
alive.</p>

<p>He had been with much violence pitched headforemost
into the ditch; and her first care was to drag
his head out of the mire, and to turn him over into an
easy position. She loosened his cravat, and bathed his
forehead with water. At last a faint groan attested
that life had not departed, and the man stirred feebly.</p>

<p>By this time a few men panting and blowing came
running up. They had heard the runaway, and pursued
as rapidly as possible, humanity and curiosity
alike spurring them on. By Patty's direction they carried
the injured man into the house of Mrs. Brown,
which chanced to be at hand; and then it was seen
that he was Peter Mixon. They were obliged to deposit
the unfortunate Peter on a lounge while the lady
of the house had a bed prepared for him.</p>

<p>"I've been meaning to have a bed made up in the
spare-room," that notable housekeeper said, "ever
since brother Phineas's folks were here last spring. I
never would have believed, Patience Sanford, that you'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
have brought him here! But there! as I was telling
Joe only the other day when our old gray cat died,
that we've had for more than ten years, our best friends
ain't to be depended upon; but they'll go off the
handle when you least expect it. And it ain't as if I
had a house full of copious apartments: I've only that
room for company. However, carry him up."</p>

<p>The sufferer was at length got to bed, a messenger
having meanwhile been sent for Dr. Sanford. Patty
thought it best to remain until her father came; as
Mrs. Brown evinced a strong disposition to stir up
the wounded man, and make him tell where he was
injured. Mixon lay unconscious, his heavy breathing
sounding painfully through Mrs. Brown's dribble of
speech. His head was badly gashed, and one of his
arms hung limp and helpless. When Dr. Sanford
came, he saw at a glance that the man was dangerously
hurt, several of his ribs being broken, and it
appearing probable that he was injured internally.
Dr. Sanford made his daughter useful while he dressed
the wounds in the patient's head.</p>

<p>"I shall stay a while," he said when this was done.
"How came you here?"</p>

<p>"I was going home, and saw him thrown out."</p>

<p>"Going home? What for?"</p>

<p>"I had a headache, and the rooms were very warm,"
she replied, dropping her eyes.</p>

<p>"Were you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Her father looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>"I won't force your confidence," he said; "but I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
seen for some time that you were unhappy. Be
careful, my daughter."</p>

<p>"I shall be as merry as a grig," she answered,
"when I have slept off this headache."</p>

<p>The wind had risen, and the sky was overcast, as
Patty hurried towards home. The leaves went scurrying
by with a hollow rustle, while all the air was full
of those eerie noises which haunt its bosom on All-Hallowe'en.
Shivering somewhat from excitement,
and more from fatigue, the girl reached her gate. The
wounded man had already given place in her mind to
the remembrance of her interview with Tom Putnam.
Now at last she felt that every thing was ended
between them. Instead of going into the house, she
crossed the garden towards the brook. Just above
the bridge was a pool which the children used to call
Black-Clear Eddy, from the singular blackness at once
and transparency of the water. Standing beside this
she dropped a stone into the pool to break the thin
film of ice which was forming. Then she unfastened
her cloak, and drew up from beneath the bosom of her
dress a silk cord, to which was fastened a hoop of
gold wire. It was her secret, known to no one but
herself. Years before, Tom Putnam had twisted this
ring carelessly from a bit of gold broken from his
sister's bracelet, and had given it to Patty for a philopena.
She held it a moment in her hand, and then
dropped it through the hole in the ice.</p>

<p>"There!" she said to herself, turning away. "That
is done. I feel so much like a sensational story, that
I am not sure I am not to be continued in our next.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
I should have done something tragic in throwing away
that trumpery ring. A few lines from 'The Faithful
Jewess' wouldn't have come in amiss:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I raise my arms to you, ye starless skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cry for pity on my hapless lot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, perjured one! Why hast thou left me lone?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Goodness, how cold it is! Good-by, old ring! Some
of the witches riding about to-night may fish you up,
and wear you to their sabbath."</p>

<p>She entered the silent house, and crept to her room,
where she got quickly to bed, only to lie and toss with
troubled thought, which would have ended in tears had
she been of weaker mettle. She fell asleep at last:
and from her mind, as from Pandora's box, slipped
every thing but hope; so that she dreamed she was
betrothed to Tom Putnam with the very ring she had
dropped into Black-Clear Eddy.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXVI." id="ChXXXVI.">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>

<h3>MRS. SMITHERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter Mixon's</span> unlucky and disreputable head
had been pretty severely battered by his accident;
and for several days he remained, as his wife
lucidly said, "unsensible." This delirium had passed
away, but Dr. Sanford had little hope of the patient's
recovery. Bathalina hung over her husband's bed
in an agony of late and needless remorse, lamenting
that her "sinful pride" had come to this; although
the connection was by no means apparent. She sang
"Death-bed Reflections" so constantly, that at last
Will Sanford threatened her with instant death if he
heard another syllable of that doleful hymn. She
labored with Peter in regard to his spiritual condition,
continually begging him to let her read aloud from
the Scriptures.</p>

<p>"You told me you was a Methodist," she said
reproachfully; "but either you lied, or you're fallen
from grace. You'd better let me read a chapter: it
may arouse your conscience."</p>

<p>"Read, then, if you want to," he said one day, too
feeble to resist.</p>

<p>"Where shall I read?" she asked delightedly, giving
her Bible a preparatory scrub with her apron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" he answered weakly, "read about David and
Goliath: that's as lively a chapter as any I know of."</p>

<p>"Peter Mixon!" cried Bathalina, "don't be blasphemous
on your death-bed! But it is a just reward
for my sinful pride that I should be the widow of an
unbeliever."</p>

<p>Both Patty and Flossy were frequent in their visits to
the sick man. He seemed grateful, in his rough way,
for their kindness, and would brighten up as they entered
the chamber. Particularly he seemed pleased
to have Patty about him, and would take from her
hand the medicine which no persuasions of his wife
could induce him to swallow.</p>

<p>"He takes to you wonderful," Bathalina said: "I
don't think he's so bad at heart."</p>

<p>"I noticed the other day," Mrs. Sanford remarked,
overhearing her, "that he has a mole on the left side
of his chin, and that's a sure sign of goodness. Not
so good as on the right side; but I don't doubt he's
right-hearted in the main."</p>

<p>Patty occupied herself more with the invalid, because
of her mental uneasiness. There is no refuge for
unhappiness but labor. Hazard Breck had returned
to college; and, before leaving, he called to bid her
good-by.</p>

<p>"I perhaps ought not to speak of it," he said hesitatingly,
as he rose to go; "but you look very unhappy
nowadays, Patty."</p>

<p>"Do I? It must be your fancy. I don't have a
mournful thought from one year's end to another.
Sentimentalizing isn't in my line."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear it is in mine," he said. "The summer has
been a very bitter-sweet one to me. I am glad it is
done."</p>

<p>"It is you who are sad," she said, bravely smiling.
"You look at me through colored glasses. I am gay
as a lark."</p>

<p>"I wish I believed it," he returned.</p>

<p>The pain of a boy's first love, although less fleeting
than the bliss, is fortunately also transient. His love
and regret were very real to Hazard. He was conscious
that Patty did not love him; but he believed
that his boyish passion would be eternal, and life for
him henceforth only desolation. That we shall some
day smile at a fancy makes the present pain none the
less poignant.</p>

<p>"You will come back at Christmas, won't you?"
Patty said, wishing to divert the conversation.</p>

<p>"No, I think not; but, if I do, I hope you won't
look as solemn as you do now."</p>

<p>"Solemn? Nonsense! I'm as merry as a cricket.
Where is your brother to-day?"</p>

<p>"He rode over to Samoset with uncle Tom this
morning. They won't be back till evening."</p>

<p>After her caller had gone, Patty turned back into
the parlor, and looked at her face in the glass.</p>

<p>"I do look like Death's second wife," she soliloquized.
"If I could only have a tremendous cry, and
get over it, I might feel better, I suppose; but I can't:
so there's an end of it. I'll go and see that wretched
old Peter instead. I think I shall eventually go as a
missionary, and nurse sick cannibals until they get well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
enough to cook and eat me. Heigh-ho! What a
wretched old Peter it is, to be sure! At least I'm
thankful to him for giving me something to do. Poor
Hazard, I wish I were half as good as he is! Patty
Sanford, you are a fool! Go and see that dilapidated
Mixon this minute!"</p>

<p>Her shortest way to the house of Mrs. Brown was
through the Putnam fields; and to-day, being sure
that the lawyer was absent, she started in this direction.
Meanwhile a whimsical fate had conducted to the
Castle in Air another woman. This visitor came
slowly over the brown fields, passing along the bank
of the brook, stopping now and then to bite into a
rose-hip, or chew the bark from some tender twig. It
was Mrs. Smithers, the woman who had summoned
Putnam to Samoset, and who had lately come to live
in the stone cottage. This woman, who among people
had a restless, constrained manner, here moved with a
free, elastic step and bearing. Her childhood had
been passed in the neighborhood of Montfield; and
Hannah Clemens had grown up as lovely as a wild
rose. Her sister Bathalina seemed to have absorbed
all the ugliness of the family, and to have gone on her
half-witted way honestly and contentedly, leaving to
the elder her fatal dowry of beauty, wit, and unhappiness.
In an evil day Mr. Mullen saw the beautiful,
ambitious girl; and to his wealth she yielded only too
readily. Never loving him, she had yet the art to
fascinate him, until, after the death of his wife, he had
been ready to marry her. Her own infatuation for a
new lover, the father of the Breck boys, had made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
refuse the hand of Mr. Mullen. Outliving both her
lovers, who died nearly at the same time, Mrs. Smithers,
as, with a slight concession to morality, she called
herself, wandered about the country, seldom content
to remain for long in one place. Her natural restlessness
was increased by her habitual use of opium; and
a habit of morose sullenness had grown upon her.
Shunned by all her kindred, it was perhaps strange
that she should have chosen to return to her native
village. She went out chiefly at night; and, having
discovered that from the Castle in Air could be seen
the tower of Mullen House, often came on moonlight
evenings to view the mansion she steadily persisted in
calling her own. To-day, having seen Putnam drive
away, she ventured to come by daylight; and she
descended the ladders just as Patty had crossed the
bridge on her way to Mrs. Brown's. The latter walked
on composedly, until, at the foot of the elm, Mrs.
Smithers blocked her path.</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. Smithers said, after examining the face
of the other a moment in silence, "what do you
want? You'll know me another time, I hope."</p>

<p>"Will you let me pass, please," Patty replied coldly.</p>

<p>"So! No: I won't let you pass till I'm ready. I'd
like to look at you a while. I've seen you before."</p>

<p>She placed her arms akimbo as she spoke, and
stared at Patty, who stood quiet.</p>

<p>"So!" she said at last. "What are you on these
premises for? What do you want? Are you after
your rights too?"</p>

<p>There was no further motive in the woman's actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
at the moment than a wild desire to vent her rage
upon any one who offered. As Patty changed color,
however, a sudden devilish inspiration darted like the
whisper of an evil spirit through Mrs. Smithers's opiumized
brain. Completely ignorant of the relations between
Patty and Putnam, she understood that her
words had been misconceived. By chance she had
hit between the joints of the harness. Patty had
refused to listen to the insinuations of her mother and
Mrs. Brown, who coupled what was known of the character
of the new tenant of the stone cottage and her
mysterious relations with the lawyer, much to the discredit
of that gentleman. Now this woman seemed
herself to confirm the slander; and it was no wonder
that Patty grew pale.</p>

<p>"So!" Mrs. Smithers said again, seizing the chance
to calumniate the man she hated none the less because
he had remained unmoved by her fascinations. "So!
We know what we know of Tom Putnam. Humph!"</p>

<p>"Will you stand out of my way?" Patty said.</p>

<p>This calmness enraged the woman before her as no
violence could have done. She caught Patty forcibly
by the wrists.</p>

<p>"So!" she screamed. "You'll hear nothing! I've
seen them has held their heads as high as you, and
been brought low enough, after all. Do you think,
miss, I'm to be ordered out of your way like a dog,
when, if I had my rights, there's nobody in this d&mdash;&mdash;d
town'd dare queen it over me! So! I'll"&mdash;</p>

<p>But Patty wrenched herself free, and ran swiftly
towards the street. The other did not follow, but
stood cursing, until a turn hid the girl from her sight.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXVII." id="ChXXXVII.">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>

<h3>THANKSGIVING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was raining, and raining with a will. It was sure
to rain all day: there was no question about that.
As Patty looked from her window Thanksgiving morning,
and saw the leafless trees and faded grass on
Boston Common, soaked in the cold November storm,
it seemed to her that she had never gazed upon a
drearier scene. She crossed her arms upon the window-sill,
resting her chin on them, and fell into a fit of
bitter musing.</p>

<p>Flossy, announcing her decision to remain in Montfield
through the winter, had coupled with it her intention
of spending Thanksgiving week at home.</p>

<p>"I must go and see father once in a while," she
remarked. "That's only respectable. And I must
have something to wear, you know, even in Montfield.
Patty is going with me to bring me back safe."</p>

<p>"I going with you?" her cousin returned. "I had
not heard of that before."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you? I supposed you'd know. As
father would say, 'There are some things which even
this Court may be supposed to understand.'"</p>

<p>Patty was secretly glad to get away. To escape
from Montfield seemed like an escape from herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
She was restless and dissatisfied, and even the remonstrances
of the family at her being away upon Thanksgiving
Day fell upon heedless ears. Once the plan was
proposed, she felt a feverish desire for its accomplishment
until she was actually in the train moving towards
Boston. At first she experienced a feeling of relief, as
if she had left care and trouble behind; but scarcely
had the hills of Montfield faded from sight than she
longed to turn back. At home she at least was where
she might see her lover, even if it were but to quarrel
with him. At home she could sit brooding at her
window, looking towards the Putnam place, and imagining
the life and the thoughts of its master. Hardly
could she restrain the tears which pressed to her eyes
as the train bore her farther and farther from home;
but with angry pride she controlled herself, and
laughed gayly at all Flossy's nonsense.</p>

<p>Mr. Plant had received her kindly; and, in the distractions
of pleasure-seeking and of shopping, Patty
had forgotten or overcome her sentimental woes until
this morning.</p>

<p>Now, with this cheerless rain steadily falling, and
Flossy closeted with her father, to whom she now
first disclosed her engagement, Patience found herself
homesick and miserable.</p>

<p>"There is one thing certain," she mused. "I have
been a fool to care for Tom as I have&mdash;and I have.
He's a man, after all; and all men are alike, I suppose,&mdash;self-contained
and self-indulgent. Not that he's as
bad as most of them; but he's a man; and&mdash;I'm a
woman. Either there must be some men different,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
or a woman could never be happy with any of them.
There! Who'd suppose I could be such a fool? I
have been very fond of Tom,&mdash;very, very fond: I'm
not sure I didn't love him just a little bit. He must
have cared for me something, or he never could have
kissed my hand so. Oh, dear! it's all over now.
There comes Floss. I wonder what uncle Chris
said."</p>

<p>"I've done it," Flossy remarked coolly, entering,
and seating herself with a nimble spring upon the
dressing-table. "The paternal astonishment is extreme,
not to say alarming."</p>

<p>"I think it likely," Patty answered.</p>

<p>"Papa didn't seem very enthusiastic over my marrying
a farmer," her cousin went on in the same
abstracted way. "But, as I told him, it isn't as if he'd
got to have the farm here in the way."</p>

<p>"Still a farm would be convenient to have in the
house," said Patty, laughing.</p>

<p>"Do you know," the other continued, "it was
only my profound sagacity that brought him round."</p>

<p>"Then he has come round?"</p>

<p>"Come round? Bless you, Pitsy-Patsy! he has
but one wish,&mdash;a desire to embrace Burleigh."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see the embrace," laughed Patty.
"With the size of the two, it would be a spectacle.
How did you accomplish it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I spoke of the milk and the butter and the
cheese&mdash;the lovely cream-cheese&mdash;and the honey.
I wonder," she interrupted herself, "that bees don't
keep a cow, cream is so ravishing with honey. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
when papa's mouth began to water, I heaved a sigh,
and so sighing I rolled up my eyes, and ejaculated
how happy we'd be. And what do you suppose he
said?"</p>

<p>"Something very profane, I'm afraid," answered
Patty.</p>

<p>"No," Floss said. "He didn't. If you'll believe
it, he only smacked his lips, and asked if Burleigh
raised early vegetables."</p>

<p>"Is that what you cried for?" asked the other,
looking at her cousin's swollen eyes.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, Floss sprang from her perch,
ran to her friend, and threw her arms about her neck,
bursting into tears. The two foolish creatures wept
together, and then kissed each other, and doubtless
felt better for the demonstration.</p>

<p>The truth was, that the interview between Mr. Plant
and his daughter had been a painful one. He cared
little for Flossy's society, and the sympathy between
them was not of the closest. But he could not,
without difficulty, reconcile himself to have his only
child, city born and bred, bury herself in the country,
and unite herself to a man so far below his idea of
a desirable match. He had received the announcement
with unaffected amazement, appearing more
deeply moved by it than Flossy had ever seen him.
It was only after a long and trying scene that he
yielded to his daughter's entreaties and his own
desire for peace, and gave a grudging consent.</p>

<p>"I think that is enough of a weep," Patty said,
giving her cousin a hug. "I'm sure I don't know
what we should cry about."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I'll tell you. He's here," said Flossy impressively.</p>

<p>"Who's here?"</p>

<p>"Burleigh."</p>

<p>"Here? In the house? Have you hidden him
in a closet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! In Boston, I mean. He's coming
to dine to-day. I told father."</p>

<p>"Of all schemers!" Patty laughed. "Really, Floss,
uncle Chris will frighten Burleigh to death. They
won't know how to take each other."</p>

<p>"No," was the answer. "But they needn't take
each other. I'm the one to be taken."</p>

<p>"O Dandelion, Floss-head!" Patience cried,
catching her cousin's face between her hands, and
looking deep into her eyes. "Are you happy, Floss?
Is being in love so delightful?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon who is in love," the little
witch answered. "Some people in that predicament
devote all their energies to making themselves uncomfortable.
Let me go: there's the postman."</p>

<p>Out of the room she darted, leaving Patty, with
cheeks aflame, to wonder how far her secret had been
divined.</p>

<p>The postman brought no letter for Flossy; but at the
same hour, in another part of the city, an epistle was
delivered bearing the Montfield postmark. Miss Sturtevant
tore it open in her cheerless room, and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<span class="smcap">Montfield</span>, Nov. 26.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Flora</span>,&mdash;Peter Mixon is getting worse, instead of
better, every day. I have tried my best to get what I want; but
there's always a crew of women about him, and he's as obstinate
as a mule. If you could come down, you'd be in the
house with him, and you might do something. Of course, if
you get the paper I would make it a good thing for you. Can't
you come this week? Patty Sanford is always round him when
she is here; but she is in Boston now, and you'd have a better
chance before she gets back. At all events, come as soon as
you can.</p>

<p>
Yours truly,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Frank Breck</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Uncle Jacob," Flora said to herself, refolding the
letter, "I shall go to Montfield to-night. Don't you
hope I may give you those papers when I get them?"</p>

<h2><a name="ChXXXVIII." id="ChXXXVIII.">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>A TEST OF CIVILIZATION.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span> we shall see," Mr. Plant remarked to his
niece as he led her down to dinner, "what
stuff Mr. Blood is made of. There is no more crucial
test of a man's civilization than the way in which he
dines."</p>

<p>"Poor Burleigh!" Patty said to herself. "Little do
you dream of the ordeal before you."</p>

<p>But Burleigh had received sundry very minute instructions
from a city cousin who had taken it upon
herself to prepare him a little for this important visit;
and, although he eyed his turtle-soup doubtfully, he
got through the first courses well enough. His diffidence
was not wholly to his disadvantage, since he
was so thoroughly in awe of his host as to treat him
with a respect which Mr. Plant found very flattering.
All went smoothly until what Flossy called the crisis
of the dinner came.</p>

<p>Dining was with Mr. Plant the chief business of life.
Other employments were in his eyes simply artifices
to kill the time which nature demanded for getting up
a proper appetite. He came to this solemn culmination
of the day with a mind prepared to hold in
reserve his judgment of the success or failure of twenty-four
hours of life until he had dined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Father begins dinner," Flossy once said, "in good
nature, because he thinks what a fine time he is going
to have. By the time he is half way through, he has
found enough things wrong to make him ready to be
cross. Then he makes a curry, or a salad; and, if that
succeeds, he comes out as happy and as gentle as a
kitten."</p>

<p>To-day it was unluckily a curry upon which the
epicure expended his energies; and having compounded
a dish which might have warmed the soul
and the liver of an old East-Indian, Mr. Plant sent a
portion to his guest with the complacent comment
that Mr. Blood would certainly find it the most delicious
curry he had ever tasted.</p>

<p>Burleigh was just then talking to Patty.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you," he said, "that Tom Putnam
came on the train with me."</p>

<p>"Tom Putnam!" exclaimed Patty.</p>

<p>"What is he in Boston for?" inquired Flossy.</p>

<p>"He is looking after that Smithers girl that ran off,"
Burleigh answered, absently conveying a generous portion
of Mr. Plant's fiery preparation to his mouth.
"Joe Brown's cousin, you know"&mdash;</p>

<p>He left his sentence unfinished, and caught wildly
at a glass of water. The curry had suddenly asserted
itself; and the general impression of the unsophisticated
Burleigh was that he had taken a mouthful of live
coals. He gasped and strangled, growing very red in
the face, setting his lips together with a firm determination
to swallow the scorching viand, or perish in the
attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it delicious?" demanded the unconscious
host, smacking his lips in unfeigned admiration.
"What the devil!" he added, looking up, and catching
a glimpse of the agonized face of his guest.</p>

<p>"Papa!" exclaimed Flossy.</p>

<p>"If Burleigh liked curry," Patty said, coming
quickly to the rescue, "he would forfeit my good
opinion forever. I think it is the most diabolical
compound that it has ever entered into the heart of
man to invent."</p>

<p>"Besides," her cousin put in, "I won't have you
spoiling Mr. Blood's digestion with any of your monstrous
mixtures. Think to what a condition you've
reduced your own suffering family!"</p>

<p>"Very well," Mr. Plant said, with the air of one who
has cast his pearls before swine. "Just as you
like."</p>

<p>"But about this Smithers girl," Patty said indifferently.
"What does he want of her?"</p>

<p>"He came to get her home again, if he can find her.
Somebody saw her on the street in Boston. But her
mother says she won't take her back."</p>

<p>"What does Mr. Putnam care about her?" queried
Flossy.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," Burleigh answered.</p>

<p>"Some old flame," volunteered Mr. Plant a little
spitefully. "I always thought Putnam couldn't be
so quiet for nothing. He's a sly old boy. So he's
after a runaway young woman, is he?"</p>

<p>A sudden and entire silence fell upon the party at
this unlucky outburst; but Patty quickly broke it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I forgot to ask, Burleigh, when you are going
home."</p>

<p>"I must go on the first train to-morrow," he answered.
"I have to be at home to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"How nice!" Patty said. "I am going then. I
am glad to have company."</p>

<p>"Patty Sanford!" cried her cousin. "You won't go
a step before Monday."</p>

<p>But remonstrances were vain. Nothing could shake
Patty's sudden determination to get away from Boston,
now that her lover had come thither. Her conversation
with Mrs. Smithers was indelibly imprinted upon
her memory; and this new proof of his intimate relations
with the woman or her daughter came to Patience
like a stab in an old wound. She made a strong effort
to hide her bitter sadness, but an irresistible impulse
drove her homeward.</p>

<p>They were all together in the parlor when Mr. Putnam's
card was handed to Patty.</p>

<p>"I will not see him!" she said excitedly, starting
up from her chair.</p>

<p>"See whom?" asked Floss; while Burleigh's face
betrayed his astonishment at this sudden outburst.</p>

<p>"Show him up here," Patty said to the servant,
recovering her self-command. In another moment
she was bowing to Tom Putnam, and giving him her
fingers with an indifference which would not have discredited
a society belle.</p>

<p>"We were speaking of your being in the city at
dinner," she said presently; "but we thought your
business so important we should hardly have the
pleasure of seeing you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Important is merely a relative term," he answered.
"I could not deny myself the pleasure of calling. I
see Mr. Plant at Montfield so seldom, that I am glad
of any excuse to get sight of him."</p>

<p>"You surely need no excuse for calling," that gentleman
said graciously. "I am always glad to see
you."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Putnam must have come to the city to
see friends who are so much more interesting," Patty
remarked, with her most dazzling smile, "that we
are indeed flattered at his remembrance."</p>

<p>The girl scarcely knew herself, so strange and unnatural
was the part she was playing. A spell seemed
to constrain her to go on wounding her lover, even
though the blow rebounded upon herself. Inwardly
she was saying to herself, "How dare he come from
pursuing that woman, and call on me?"</p>

<p>She nerved herself to the task; and, under a show of
the utmost cordiality, she lashed Tom Putnam with all
the scorn and sarcasm of which she was mistress. He
received with dignity her attacks, or parried them
adroitly; but he did not make his call a long one.</p>

<p>"God forgive us!" Mr. Plant said as soon as the
lawyer had taken leave. "What had that poor devil
done, Patty, that you baited him so? And he took it
like a hero. If he didn't deserve it, you ought to be
bastinadoed; and, if he did, he's brazen-faced enough.
Anyway he's plucky. You treated him like a dog."</p>

<p>The company were decidedly out of spirits. Flossy
was angry with her cousin's treatment of Putnam, and
Burleigh was confused and uncomfortable by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
state of the mental atmosphere. As for Mr. Plant, he
was annoyed at his niece, at Mr. Blood, at the disturbances
which hindered the usual slow and placid
digestion of his dinner. He had resolutely avoided
giving Burleigh an opportunity of seeing him alone;
and now the poor suitor, lacking courage to ask for
an interview, found himself obliged to speak out, or
leave his errand undone.</p>

<p>"Mr. Plant," he blurted out after a period of perfect
silence, in which he had been screwing his courage to
the sticking-point, "I want to marry your daughter."</p>

<p>His host started as if a bomb had dropped at his
feet.</p>

<p>"I like your impudence," he said.</p>

<p>"Sir?" stammered poor Burleigh, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Mr. Plant continued, his impatience
finding vent at last, and pouring upon the head
of the bewildered suitor. "Does Flossy look as if
she'd make a good farmer's wife? Can you give her
any thing to compensate for what she must sacrifice
in marrying so far outside her circle? I repeat, I like
your impudence!"</p>

<p>"I know she would be sacrificing," began Burleigh;
but the irate father, whose annoyance had been
increasing all day, interrupted.</p>

<p>"Sacrificing!" he said, "of course she is sacrificing.
God save us! You'd be an idiot if you didn't
know she was sacrificing a thousand times more than
you can even understand. What right had you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa," Flossy said, very pale, stepping up to her
lover, and clasping her hands about his brawny arm,&mdash;"you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
forget, papa, that this is the man I am going to
marry."</p>

<p>"Mr. Plant," Burleigh said, lifting his head proudly,
and drawing his tiny betrothed close to him, "I never
pretended to be worthy of your daughter, and never
hoped to be; but she could not find one who would
love her better, or be more honest in trying to make
her life happy."</p>

<p>"Uncle Chris," whispered Patty, taking his arm,
"come into the library."</p>

<p>"God save us!" he ejaculated, looking at her.
"What are you crying for?&mdash;There, Mr. Blood, shake
hands. Good-night, both of you.&mdash;Come, Patty."</p>

<h3>THE NIGHT-WATCH.</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I think</span>, Patty," her mother said as the last word
of a long and vain argument, "that you'll end by
bringing my gray hairs to a grave in a lunatic-asylum.
You are crazy to think of sitting up with Peter to-night.
You are tired out with your ride from Boston
anyway."</p>

<p>"But Bathalina has a sick-headache, mother, and
I'm only to stay until eleven. Good-night. I'd rather
go."</p>

<p>It was the night following Thanksgiving, and Patty
had carried out her intention of coming home in the
morning. As she walked over to Mrs. Brown's, she
seemed to herself to be free from all bodily fatigue,
so strongly did her inner excitement buoy her up.
She resolutely endeavored to put away all thought of
Tom Putnam and the Smithers women; but the consciousness
of painful suspicion flowed as a bitter undercurrent
through all her musings.</p>

<p>The sick man was unusually tractable that night.</p>

<p>"I'm afeared, Miss Patience," his wife said tearfully,
"I'm afeared he's goin' for it. He hasn't swored
at me but twice to-day, and one of them his gruel
was too hot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was only your soothing influence," Patty answered
dispiritedly. "You can go home, and go to
bed. I'll watch with him until Sol comes at eleven."</p>

<p>Left alone, the watcher seated herself in the shadow,
and plunged anew into distracting and painful reveries;
but she quickly was called from them by the sick
man.</p>

<p>"I'd like to ask yer to do somethin'," he said
feebly.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, going to the bedside.</p>

<p>"Frank Breck's been here," he answered, "tryin'
to get my pocket-book; and the women-folks are
awful curious too."</p>

<p>One of his first requests on recovering consciousness
had been for this pocket-book, which since he
had guarded beneath his pillow.</p>

<p>"There's papers in it," Peter went on, "they hadn't
ought to see. I want you to keep it for me."</p>

<p>"You seem to keep it very well yourself," she said
rather absently.</p>

<p>"Oh! but it's wearin' on me," he returned. "If it
isn't took care of for me, I shall kick the bucket sure."</p>

<p>"Why should I take it?"</p>

<p>"I reckon," he said, "that you're one could hold
your tongue, or anyways would stick to your word,
specially to a man with his ribs all drove into him. I
want you to keep it till I get well, and promise not to
open it."</p>

<p>"Very well," she replied. "If it will make you
feel easier, I promise."</p>

<p>The sick man drew from beneath the pillow a black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and oily-looking pocket-book, long and flat, and apparently
empty. It was so dirty, that Patty seized the
first piece of paper at hand, and wrapped it up, thinking
to herself that the valuable papers probably existed
only in the imagination of the invalid.</p>

<p>"You are very mysterious and dramatic, my friend,"
she said to herself. "Is this perhaps a chapter from
'The Blood-boultered Battering-Ram;' or every-day
life in Montfield?"</p>

<p>The incident turned her thoughts somewhat from
herself, and her weariness asserted itself. Seeing that
the patient had sunk into a quiet sleep, Patty lay back
in her chair, and let herself drift away into a soft
drowse.</p>

<p>It was about half-past ten when she found herself
suddenly wide awake from a profound sleep. A presence
in the room made itself felt before she opened
her eyes, and she cautiously peered between her
scarcely parted lids without moving. The light was
as she had left it, turned down and dim. The heavy
breathings of the sick man told that he was still sleeping.
Above his bed bent the figure of a woman.
Her back was towards the watcher; and, as Patty
opened her eyes, she recognized the stooping form as
that of Flora Sturtevant. With a cautious, cat-like
movement, the woman slid her hand beneath Mixon's
pillow, searching for something which Frank Breck
had assured her was to be found there. As Patty
watched, her mind gathered up with marvellous quickness
the allusions made by the sick man to Breck;
and, knowing the long intimacy between the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and Miss Sturtevant, it was not difficult to guess her
errand.</p>

<p>"Do you find what you want?" Patty at length
asked coolly.</p>

<p>The other started away from the bed, and turned
quickly.</p>

<p>"Patty Sanford!" she exclaimed. "They said his
wife was here."</p>

<p>"She is not, you see."</p>

<p>"My room is next this," Flora continued, regaining
her self-command, "and, hearing your heavy breathing,
I thought the patient might need attention: so I came
in."</p>

<p>"Oh!" the watcher said incredulously. "That was
very kind of you. I think Sol Shankland is coming
now, and he can keep awake: so you need not trouble
any further."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was about four in the afternoon of the next day,
when Bathalina returned from a visit to Mrs. Brown's.
Mrs. Sanford heard her come in, and sent her daughter
to inquire for the sick man.</p>

<p>Patty waited to finish something she was doing; so
that, by the time she reached the kitchen, Mrs. Mixon
had been to her chamber, and brought down a black
dress, which she was engaged in ripping up, to the
accompaniment of a doleful minor.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Patty asked.</p>

<p>"I'm breaking down my black alpaccy," was the
reply. "I'm goin' to have it made over, and trimmed
with crape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Trimmed with crape? What for?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm a widow now."</p>

<p>"A widow!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Peter's gone. I knew he couldn't last much
longer. He's been failin', gradual, for a week. You
must ha' noticed it."</p>

<p>"But I didn't think," Patty began, wondering how
to phrase the condolences it seemed proper to offer
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"No, nor I didn't, neither," the widow remarked,
as she hesitated. "I thought he'd hold out longer,
or I'd have been more forehanded with my black
dress. Anyway I'm glad he got through it before
cold weather sot in. It's easier for him. And, besides,
Mrs. Brown's house is awful draughty, spec'ly as she
never gets ready to have it banked before spring."</p>

<p>"If we can do any thing for you," Patty said, exerting
herself to preserve a grave face, "we shall be glad
to."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly," the servant answered. "I'll
let you know if there is. I never had much comfort
as Peter's wife," she added; "for he was real onery, as
you might say: but it's some satisfaction to be his
widow; widows are so respectable."</p>

<p>This was too much for Patty's gravity; and she retreated
precipitately, leaving the widow to "break
down" her black dress at leisure.</p>

<p>Peter Mixon was interred with due solemnity, aunty
Jeff coming to take her part in the mourning, with
much unction. She had never favored her niece's
marriage, it was true, and regarded the deceased as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
a very black sheep indeed. But to her mind numerous
funerals conferred a certain distinction upon a family,
and it was a duty which she owed at once to her relatives
and to society to see that the mourning was
properly attended to. So the dead man was put
under the sod, and in time came to the one good appointed
to all men,&mdash;to nourish the grass and the
daisies. Bathalina arrayed herself in her widow's weeds
with the satisfaction of a new importance, and began
soon to speak of her departed spouse with great regret
and affection, persuading herself in time that she sincerely
mourned for him, and lamenting that her "sinful
pride" had made necessary for her good the severe
trial of his loss.</p>

<p>And here it may be mentioned that Frank Breck
searched carefully among the effects of the dead man
for certain papers which he did not find, because they
were in the possession of Patty Sanford.</p>

<h3>CLARENCE AGAIN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Soberly</span> and slowly Patty was walking towards
home on the last day of November. The rain
had been falling at intervals through the day, interspersed
with spits of snow. Not far from her own
gate Patty encountered Clarence Toxteth. The afternoon
was already drawing to a close, the gray clouds
cutting off the last faint rays of daylight; and, as the
young man was somewhat near-sighted, he did not
recognize her until they were face to face.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. "I am delighted to meet you. I
have been to see you."</p>

<p>"Will you turn back now?" she responded.</p>

<p>"I've wanted to see you," said he, turning, "ever
since the masquerade; but you were always with that
sick tramp."</p>

<p>"I am emulating Florence Nightingale," she returned
lightly. "You'll doubtless hear of me some day
as a famous sister of charity, or cousin of mercy, or
aunt of benevolence, or something of the sort."</p>

<p>"Really? You don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell what one does mean?" she queried
wilfully. "Will you come and see me take the veil?
A nun's life must be dreadfully tame and insipid, but
the dress is becoming."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean?" her companion asked, puzzled.
"You can't be in earnest."</p>

<p>"In earnest? I fancy people are as seldom in
earnest as they are in love; but it is easy enough to
persuade one's self of being either."</p>

<p>Clarence looked at her with so confused an air, that
she burst out into a laugh. Her mood had changed
into a mocking, insincere phase; and she experienced
a wicked delight in baffling and bewildering her suitor.</p>

<p>"It is a round world," she went on, giving her
extravagance more and more the rein, "and round
things are apt to be slippery. It is rather trite to call
life a masquerade; but it is one, all the same. You
fancy you see my face. You are mistaken, it is only
a mask: in fact, I dare say you never see your own.
Not that it matters in the least, for you're better off
for having flattering glasses. I shall hate to wash the
convent-floors, for they'll be stone, and awfully cold;
but I suppose I shall have to."</p>

<p>"Yes," Clarence stammered. He had not the
faintest notion what she was talking about; but the
word "masquerade" seemed to furnish a clew. "Why
didn't you come to the masquerade?" he asked.
"You and Flossy and Burleigh were all missing when
we unmasked. You lost your gloves."</p>

<p>"I was there, and you did not know me: so I won."</p>

<p>"But what became of you?"</p>

<p>"I went out to get a breath of air, and that Peter
Mixon got thrown out of his carriage at my very feet.
Of course I didn't feel like going back after that."</p>

<p>"There are some things very mysterious about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
night," Toxteth said. "I'm sure I don't know half
that went on in my own house."</p>

<p>"Who ever did?" she retorted. "I'm sure you
are better off. Will you come in?"</p>

<p>They had reached the piazza by this time, and Patty
laid her hand upon the door-handle.</p>

<p>"I think not," he answered. "They will wait tea
for me at home. But I want to ask you something."</p>

<p>"It is dangerous to ask things in this world," she
said, "there is always so much uncertainty what the
answer will be."</p>

<p>"But I am in uncertainty now."</p>

<p>"That can't be pleasant," replied she; "but the
frying-pan is better than the fire. It cannot be any
thing that concerns yourself, however, or you couldn't
hesitate about it."</p>

<p>"It does concern me, and I want it answered."</p>

<p>"Really?" she said, angry that she could not evade
him. "When the sultan throws the handkerchief, I
supposed he never had a doubt of its reception."</p>

<p>"Throws the handkerchief? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"It is a Turkish custom, which has been copied the
world over by those favored individuals whom fate or
fortune has made irresistible; only the handkerchief
must be gold-edged."</p>

<p>"If you are going to talk nonsense," the young
man said, offended, "I may as well go."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Patty retorted, giving her umbrella a
flirt. "Do you call it nonsense? It is the most serious
thing I know. However, it is no matter. I am
hindering you. Good-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait," he said. "You promised me an answer
long ago, and you've never given it to me."</p>

<p>"An answer? An answer to what?"</p>

<p>"You know what," he said doggedly. "To the
question I asked you the day we went to Samoset."</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to think," she answered
weakly. "First there was the exhibition, and then
the masquerade, and then Peter Mixon's sickness."</p>

<p>"If you require so much time to think," returned
he bitterly, "that is answer enough."</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll consider the matter settled."</p>

<p>"No, no!" he exclaimed. "Take your own time.
I'll wait. But you ought to answer me."</p>

<p>"That is true," assented Patty gloomily. "Give
me a week, only a week, and I will."</p>

<p>"In a week then," he said, "I shall come for my
answer. Don't make it 'no,' Patty."</p>

<h2><a name="ChXLI." id="ChXLI.">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>

<h3>OLD MULLEN'S WILL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter Mixon</span> was safely bestowed beneath the
sod before Patty remembered the pocket-book
which he had confided to her care. One afternoon
when she chanced to be alone in the house, she came
upon it, and, opening it, began idly enough to examine
the contents. There was little of importance
except a bulky document which proved to be a will,
although, so little accustomed was she to legal phraseology,
it was some time before the reader comprehended
the full import of the instrument. Slowly she
realized that the paper to which Peter Mixon had
clung so tenaciously, and which Frank Breck had
wished to obtain was a will executed by old Mr.
Mullen; and that in it he bequeathed real estate and
personal property, without reserve, to Mrs. Smithers.
With the will in her hand, Patty sat pondering on the
consequences of its discovery. Her thoughts turned
first to the legatee, and she pictured to herself Mrs.
Smithers as mistress of Mullen House and its splendors.
She would hardly have been human, and certainly
would not have been a woman, had she not
bitterly hated one who had robbed her of security in
her faith of her lover. What she believed of Putnam's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
relations with his tenant, Patty hardly knew. She had
heard scandals concerning this woman and the late
owner of Mullen House; and the character of Mrs.
Smithers, even charity could scarcely call doubtful. She
was still, in spite of her thirty-five years and her turbulent
life, remarkably handsome; and her daughter,
whom the lawyer had followed to Boston, was more
beautiful still. Patty refused to believe absolute evil
of Tom, but jealousy and doubt cast their blighting
shadows over her heart.</p>

<p>From considering Mrs. Smithers, thought naturally
turned to the present occupants of Mullen House.
In regard to Miss Mullen, Patty was little troubled;
but for Ease she was perplexed and grieved. She sat
confused and excited by the complex thoughts and
feelings which crowded upon her. Suddenly the
door-bell rang, and its echoes sounded through the
empty house. At this moment of all others, a carriage
had come with a message from Miss Mullen, requesting
Miss Sanford to come to her on important business.
The strangeness of the summons struck Patty.
There was no one at home with whom to advise. She
hesitated a moment, but ended by deciding to go;
and, with the will she had just read in her pocket, she
was driven towards Mullen House.</p>

<p>During the past few weeks the inner life at Mullen
House had been stormy enough. Miss Tabitha had
daily pressed upon her niece, with increased vehemence,
the suit of Frank Breck. As she met with
constant resistance, however, the proud woman began
to melt from command into entreaty; but, while Ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
could not but be moved by this change, it is possible
that it defeated itself. There is in the gentlest human
breast a trace of selfish pride, which takes pleasure,
often half-unconsciously, in the humiliation of authority.
When tyranny condescends to supplication, it
confesses its power broken, and for its fall there is
little respect or pity. In vain did Miss Tabitha&mdash;not
explaining the secret of Breck's power, however&mdash;picture
the ruin of the family honor, the calamity of
the lapsing of Mullen House into the hands of strangers.
Ease had learned to lean upon Will Sanford in
her perplexity; and, with the trusting faith of a girl's
first love, she believed that for all evils her lover would
somehow find a remedy.</p>

<p>Miss Tabitha herself was moved chiefly by the prospect
of abandoning her place in Montfield society.
She had posed so long upon her semi-theatrical elevation
that she dreaded worse than death a descent
to the level of commonplace life. In addition to the
usual evils attendant upon the loss of property, the
whole habit of her existence, her methods of thought,
the narrowness of the circle of her interests, bound her
yet more strongly to the old <i>régime</i>. In her accustomed
orbit she moved with dignity and precision,
but she lacked the broad strength of character needful
for adjustment to new and unfavorable conditions.
In her struggle to induce Ease to marry Frank Breck,
she felt as if it was for life itself she were fighting; and
the latter was clever enough to take advantage of this
feeling, even while not wholly understanding it.</p>

<p>Breck was no histrionic villain in sable cloak and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
drooping plume, or even in gaiters and slouched hat.
He was simply an unscrupulous young man, sensuous,
and morally weak, inheriting from his father that selfishness
which is so nearly akin to the relentless instinct
of self-preservation in animals. Self-gratification
was the essential law of his being.</p>

<p>Breck and Miss Mullen met upon the common
ground of need. His expensive tastes made poverty
as intolerable to him as it was bewildering and abhorrent
to her. When he assured the mistress of Mullen
House that he would save her from ruin only at the
price of the hand of Ease, Miss Tabitha was ready
to consent to any sacrifice on the part of her niece
sooner than to encounter the loss of home and fortune.
It was as a last desperate effort that she had
sent for Patience, being urged to the step by Frank,
who showed in this case more zeal than discretion.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXLII." id="ChXLII.">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>

<h3>BOLD PLAY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Patience reached Mullen House, she
was shown into the drawing-room, where she
found Miss Mullen alone. The room was in keeping
with its stately mistress. Its furniture was massive,
and black with age, its draperies heavy and rich.
Miss Tabitha evidently made an especial effort to
appear gracious, coming forward to meet her guest
with an effusive greeting very unlike her usual reserve.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon for sending for you," she said;
"but I wanted to see you alone. Take this chair: it
is easier than that one. I hope you are very well."</p>

<p>Patty met the advances of her hostess somewhat
coldly; but the latter determinedly ignored this, and
talked lightly of indifferent things, until the guest cut
her short by asking somewhat abruptly why Miss
Mullen wished for her. Then that lady became somewhat
embarrassed, and found it difficult to introduce
the delicate business of the interview.</p>

<p>"It is about Ease," she said, after some preliminary
skirmishing; "about Ease and&mdash;and myself. I sent
for you because you have so much influence over
her. You have such a strong character, Patty! And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
besides, this concerns indirectly a member of your
family."</p>

<p>Patty sat silent, beginning to surmise vaguely what
was coming.</p>

<p>"I must tell you a family secret," the elder lady
went on. "It isn't fit for me to tell, or you to hear;
but you cannot understand our trouble if I don't. My
father&mdash;perhaps you have heard the scandals, the
stories about that Smithers woman."</p>

<p>The other assented silently.</p>

<p>"My father," Miss Mullen continued desperately,
"was completely imposed upon by that miserable creature.
He even wanted to marry the vile thing; and
she succeeded in extorting from him a paper which
gave her Mullen House after his death."</p>

<p>"A will," Patty said.</p>

<p>"Yes," the other admitted,&mdash;"a sort of a will, I
suppose. I never saw it, but Mr. Breck called it so."</p>

<p>"Mr. Breck!"</p>

<p>"Yes. He had far more to do with that vile woman
than my father, though, of course, they kept it hid, so
as to get money from father; and Mr. Breck had this
paper."</p>

<p>"How did he get it?"</p>

<p>"She says he got somebody to steal it. The miserable
creature came here once, and threatened to turn
me out of the house. And O Patty! she could do it
if she had that paper."</p>

<p>"But where is it now?"</p>

<p>"Frank Breck has it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Patty said, light breaking in upon her. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
an instant she comprehended the bold game Frank
had been playing. Pretending to have the paper
which he had failed to obtain from Mixon, and which
lay at that moment in her pocket, he had demanded
the hand of Ease as its price.</p>

<p>"He declares," poor Miss Mullen said, "that, unless
Ease marries him, he will ruin us; and he can do it."</p>

<p>"He is contemptible enough to do it," Patty
returned with curling lip. "He'd do any thing for
his own ends. But what has all this to do with me?"</p>

<p>"O Patty! you've so much influence with Ease:
she admires you so much! You couldn't see us turned
out of house and home! If you would talk to her,
and persuade her, and show her how much depends
upon her. You could bring her to it, I'm sure. She
won't listen to me. And if you'd get your brother to
go away a while"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop!" Patty exclaimed, starting to her feet.
"How dare you talk to me in that way! I shall tell
Ease, that, if she consents to marry Frank Breck, she
will be too contemptible for honest people to speak
to."</p>

<p>The proud mistress of Mullen House caught Patty's
hand, even fell on her knees to her, weeping, and begging
her to pity her gray hairs.</p>

<p>"Get up," said Patty, chilled and repelled by the
intense selfishness which every word displayed. "You
care nothing for Ease; but she is safe, at least. I
have your father's will here: Peter Mixon gave it to
me before he died."</p>

<p>Miss Mullen gave a cry, and fell back into a sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
posture, white and staring; while from the embrasure
of a window behind whose curtain she had concealed
him that he might overhear the interview, sprang
Frank Breck.</p>

<p>"That will belongs to me," he said. "Peter Mixon
got it from Mrs. Smithers for father, and never delivered
it to him. Give it to me!"</p>

<p>"It belongs to Mrs. Smithers," Patty returned,
standing at bay. "I shall give it to its rightful owner."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Miss Mullen, seizing again the
hand of her guest. "No, no! She could turn us into
the street the minute she got it. Oh, for pity's sake,
Patience, give it to me! I shall die of shame if Mullen
House gets into her hands. Oh, for the love of
God, let me have it! Think of Ease. You love her.
Will shall marry her. I'll give them my part in all the
property&mdash;but just enough to live on. I'll do any
thing, any thing, any thing, if only you'll give me that
will. Don't rob us of our home and all we have!"</p>

<p>"It isn't I that rob you," Patty said sadly.</p>

<p>"By God!" Frank cried, grasping roughly, in his
turn, the hand which Patty freed from the convulsive
clasp of Miss Mullen, "you shall give it to me. You
shall never take it out of this house, if I have to kill
you!"</p>

<p>Patty uttered a scream which rang through the
dusky old room, and by a strong and sudden effort
wrenched herself free, throwing her assailant to his
knees; then she turned, and darted out of the room
and out of the house. As she gained the long avenue,
she heard Breck in pursuit, and she ran as she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
never run before in the most hoydenish days of her
girlhood. He overtook her just as she reached the
great gate, but not before she had seen the figure of a
man in the street.</p>

<p>"Help, help!" she cried.</p>

<p>In another instant Tom Putnam stood between her
and his nephew. The lawyer looked from one to the
other in amazement; while Patty, panting and breathless,
thrust into his hands the will, but could not speak.
Frank attempted to snatch the precious document,
but his uncle held him off.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked. "What does this mean,
Frank?"</p>

<p>"It means that between you, you are making a
devilish mess," the young man said in a rage; "and
I wash my hands of it.&mdash;I wish you joy of what you
have done."</p>

<p>He cast a scowling look at Patty, as he addressed
to her the last words, and, not heeding his uncle's
voice, strode off down the street.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what all this is about?" Tom
asked, unfolding the will.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself," she answered. "It is
about that&mdash;about your tenant."</p>

<p>"My tenant?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said coldly,&mdash;"Mrs. Smithers."</p>

<p>She turned away, and walked in the direction of her
home. She felt the bitterest humiliation in speaking
to the man she loved the name of the woman of his
relations to whom she dared not think.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said: "I am going with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>A quick step placed him at her side; but she had
averted her face. He laid his hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" she exclaimed, shaking off his
fingers. "I will not bear it. Take that will to her,
and give her your congratulations."</p>

<p>"What?" he cried. "You have heard,&mdash;but you
cannot have believed"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believed!" she retorted fiercely. "I believe
nothing but that she told me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Before she could answer, Dr. Sanford's buggy rolled
along towards them.</p>

<p>"Take me home, father," cried poor Patty.</p>

<p>And a moment later Tom Putnam was left alone.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXLIII." id="ChXLIII.">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>

<h3>CLARENCE IS ANSWERED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> week which Patty had asked of Clarence Toxteth
had expired; and that young lady was in
her chamber, giving the last touches to her toilet before
going down to the parlor to meet her suitor. The
days seemed to her to have passed with flying feet.
She had occupied herself much more in thinking how
short a space she had for deliberation than in considering
the important question she was now to answer.
She therefore found herself no nearer a conclusion
when Clarence called than when she had dismissed
him a week earlier.</p>

<p>Her toilet completed, the girl leaned her face upon
her hands, and regarded herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>"I must decide," she mused. "I must give him
an answer. I never can say yes. Suppose he should
want to touch me, or to kiss me. Ugh! I should
die! How red my face is! It must be because I
hurried so. The color is becoming, though. I ought
to go down, but it will do him good to wait a while;
and I must think.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish a woman was independent as a man is!
Then I needn't be engaged to anybody. But I never
can care for anybody as I did for Tom. How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Tom be so&mdash;how could he act so! I must be engaged
to Clarence to show Tom that I'm not heart-broken
for him. Oh, how I hate Tom Putnam!&mdash;at
least I hate the way he acts. Hate makes more
matches than love, I dare say. What nonsense! Let
me think: I must think. I'm sure Clarence is nice.
He has so refined personal habits! And then his
wife could have any thing money could buy. Wife?
There's time enough to think of that: this is only the
engagement, and I dare say one gets fond of any man
by being engaged to him long enough. Perhaps I
should get to be willing to be Mrs. Toxteth. I'm
sure I hope so. This comb is certainly in a little bit
too high. There! I am pretty, but a girl is despised
forever that will own she thinks herself so. Dear me!
I must go down stairs and see that horrid Clarence.
I'm sure I don't see why he need be forever bothering
me for an answer. How unhappy I am! and I'm
afraid I deserve it. I wonder if he wouldn't give me
a week longer. No, I don't think I quite dare to
ask for that: I've treated him shamefully now. But
I'll make amends: I'll say yes, but I do hate to
awfully."</p>

<p>And down stairs swept the young lady to meet the
suitor to whom she had decided to plight her troth.
He rose to meet her, uttering some polite commonplace,
and she began to rattle on about the gossip of
Montfield. She dreaded the question he had come
to ask; yet soon she began to experience an irritated
desire that he would speak, and end this suspense.
She carried that fatal yes as a burden of which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
would fain be rid as quickly as possible. At last the
question came.</p>

<p>"Have you thought that the week you asked is
up?" Clarence inquired.</p>

<p>"I remembered it," she answered, dropping her
eyelids.</p>

<p>"You haven't given me my answer."</p>

<p>"Did you expect me to come to you with it?" she
asked, fencing to gain time.</p>

<p>"Of course not; but I have come for it."</p>

<p>"I am not worth so much trouble," she said.</p>

<p>"Is that my answer?"</p>

<p>"Certainly it isn't," she replied. "But why must
you be in such haste about it?"</p>

<p>"Haste about it!" he repeated. "I should think I
had waited long enough. If I am not worth answering,
I cannot be worth marrying."</p>

<p>His indignation influenced Patty in his favor; but
alas! his last word made her shudder.</p>

<p>"Oh! It isn't that," she ambiguously exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But do you mean to say yes, or no?" Clarence
demanded with some irritation.</p>

<p>Patty looked at him with dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"It must come," she thought, "and then I shall be
engaged to him, and he'll have the right to kiss me;
but I must say it."</p>

<p>She opened her lips to give the fatal assent.</p>

<p>"No," they said, it seemed to her entirely without
her volition.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I said 'no,'" she repeated, feeling as if amare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
had been removed from her breast. "I like you
very much, Clarence; but I don't think we are quite
suited for each other."</p>

<p>"You don't!" he retorted, smarting with wounded
love and vanity. "Then why couldn't you say so at
once, and not keep me making a fool of myself for
nothing all summer?"</p>

<p>"I own I've treated you horridly," she said humbly.
"And I beg your pardon; but I didn't know my own
mind."</p>

<p>"You ought to have known," he continued, becoming
more angry as she grew more yielding. "You
may go farther and fare worse, Patty Sanford. I
might have known you were leading me on. I always
thought you were a flirt, but I did think you'd treat
an old friend decently. Thank Heaven, I needn't go
to the world's end for a wife!"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Mistress Sanford said, drawing herself
up with fine dignity. "I congratulate you on your
escape from the snare into which I have been leading
you. I might have known your penetration was too
keen not to see through the wiles of a mere flirt."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;that is"&mdash;he stammered in confusion.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I have taken so much of your
time," she continued. "But then, as you just remarked
so happily, it isn't as if you had to go to the
world's end to find a wife."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean" began he, thoroughly abashed,&mdash;"I
didn't mean"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very likely not," she interrupted. "I didn't
either. I beg your pardon," she added more calmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
"Did I show you those views aunt Shasta sent us from
Paris last week?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I don't know," Clarence replied. "I must
be going."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you called," Patty said. "I have
enjoyed it very much. You must be neighborly. You
know the Brecks are gone; and Flossy is so absorbed
in Burleigh that I am sure to be lonesome."</p>

<p>And she bowed out the rejected suitor, who went
home with a tingling sensation about his ears.</p>

<p>"I might have known," he muttered to himself;
"but her mother was so sure she'd have me. Confound
it! It isn't safe to trust anybody's opinion of
a woman but your own, and it's best to be d&mdash;&mdash;d
doubtful of that."</p>

<p>As for Patty, she went back to her chamber bitterly
ashamed of herself, yet happier than she had been for
many a long day.</p>

<h2><a name="ChXLIV." id="ChXLIV.">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>

<h3>WILL AND EASE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> Mrs. Smithers had begun proceedings
for obtaining the property willed her
by Mr. Mullen. The days which followed at Mullen
House were gloomy ones. Mr. Wentworth came
down only to spend the larger part of his time and
strength in cursing and fuming, which added little to
the comfort of his client or her niece. To Ease,
leaving the homestead could not be what it was to her
aunt, who had no life apart from its theatrical stateliness.
But Miss Mullen was too energetic to fold her
hands. In less than a week from the time Mrs.
Smithers put in a claim for the property, Miss Tabitha
announced that she had made arrangements to take
up her abode with a cousin residing in Boston.</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" Ease asked in dismay.</p>

<p>"I was wondering this morning what you intended,"
her aunt said coolly. "As you have been the means
of our losing all we have, I supposed you must have
some plans. I hope you won't disgrace the family.
If your father hadn't been a spendthrift, you'd have as
much as I have to live on."</p>

<p>The sisters had each inherited a small property from
their mother, and upon this Miss Tabitha had now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
depend. Mrs. Apthorpe's portion had been expended
in the last illness of her husband, who lingered between
life and death five tedious years, during which Mr.
Mullen had refused the slightest aid to his heart-broken
daughter.</p>

<p>In these dark days, when Miss Tabitha was showing
a spirit equally hard, Ease turned for comfort to Will
Sanford. Accustomed to lean upon others, she found
his presence and help a necessity. He had but one
solution for her difficulties,&mdash;that of matrimony.</p>

<p>"But we are not even engaged," Ease protested.</p>

<p>"Oh! it isn't necessary to be engaged before you
are married," he answered. "That can be attended
to afterward quite as well."</p>

<p>Still, to marry on nothing a year is a delicate matter;
and Will consulted his father in his perplexity.</p>

<p>"Married?" the doctor said. "What have you to
live on?"</p>

<p>The son drew from his pocket a handful of silver,
which he eyed doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That is about the extent of my available capital."</p>

<p>"Not a very substantial basis upon which to acquire
a family," his father said.</p>

<p>"I wish," exclaimed Will, rattling the coins he held,
"that I had as much money as I could lift; and oh,
wouldn't I lift!"</p>

<p>"No doubt," Dr. Sanford assented grimly. "But
you haven't; and it takes money to support a wife.
Young love is delightful company, but a great eater."</p>

<p>"But there are two sides to the question," said Will.
"Ease must be thought of. That old tabby-cat Tabitha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
has deserted her, and I can't stand by and see
her turned out of house and home. And there's no
other way I can help her. I might go to teaching
school to support myself; but in the long-run I can
make more at my profession. Now, will you lend me
the money I need till I can pay my way?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy, debt is a pestilence which walketh
at noonday, and doesn't lie quiet at night, nor let
you."</p>

<p>"But I must endure that rather than let Ease suffer."</p>

<p>"But don't fancy I should forgive you the debt."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," Will said, unconsciously drawing
himself up. "I didn't mean to beg a living."</p>

<p>"That strikes fire," his father said, laughing. "I
think you had better arrange the matter with Ease as
soon as you can, and have things settled. I am proud
of your choice too."</p>

<p>"I"&mdash;Will began; but, instead of speech, he wrung
his father's hand, and was off for Mullen House.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ChXLV." id="ChXLV.">CHAPTER XLV.</a></h2>

<h3>A QUIET WEDDING.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> marriage of Will and Ease was naturally a
quiet one. Wedding Ease with the certainty of
hard work before him, and with the consciousness of
taking up a man's burdens, Will was thoughtful and
grave. He was full of a serious joy, and, as Patty
declared, began already to look older and more sedate.
Regret as he might the loss to his bride of her old
home, he secretly experienced a virile joy that their
fortunes were to be of his own carving.</p>

<p>"My boy," Dr. Sanford said to him upon the eve
of his wedding-day, "make two agreements with your
wife the day you marry, and stick to them,&mdash;never to
cry over spilt milk, and never to cross a bridge till
you come to it. That takes care of the past and the
future; and, if you cannot bear the present together,
you had better separate."</p>

<p>Bathalina, too, had her word to say.</p>

<p>"I approve of your bein' married," she said.
"Some folks don't take no stock in folks gettin'
married so young; but I believe in it. Then you ain't
so much older than your children that they treat you
as if you was their grand-dad; but they're kind of
company for you. Now, when you get to be an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
man, you may have a son as old as or older than
yourself to stick by you. I always believed in folks
bein' married young myself."</p>

<p>The ceremony took place at the Episcopal church,
which the Mullens had for years attended, and was
wholly free from display.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" Dr. Sanford greeted the newly-wedded
pair as they stepped over the threshold of his
home. "May you never be less in love than
now!"</p>

<p>On the following day Miss Mullen flitted from
Montfield like the last-remaining bittern, and established
herself with her maiden cousin in Boston, where
she gradually recovered her normal condition, and
posed before a circle of select if somewhat antiquated
people, among whom she soon came to feel perfectly
at home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life in Montfield went on much as usual.
Tom Putnam endeavored vainly to come to an understanding
with Patty. She resolutely avoided him,
except on a single occasion. As Ease and Patty sat
sewing one day, conversation turned on Mrs. Toxteth's
masquerade.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Ease said, "I never found out
what you wore? Emily Purdy told me beforehand
that you were going in a man's dress, but of course I
didn't believe that."</p>

<p>"Emily Purdy!" exclaimed Patty.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole matter was clear to her,
and she saw how Putnam had obtained his knowledge
of her costume. The following day she met the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
lawyer on the street, and stopped him with a little
gesture of the hand.</p>

<p>"It is hardly worth while to bother you with apologies,"
she said; "but I shall respect myself a trifle
more if I tell you that I have discovered how you
knew of my masquerade-dress, and I beg your pardon
for so misjudging you."</p>

<p>"You do not need to apologize," said he eagerly.
"It is I who should"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not at all," she interrupted. "Good-morning."</p>

<p>And she walked swiftly away.</p>

<p>For the rest of our friends, Burleigh continually
urged upon Flossy the desirability of a speedy marriage;
Clarence Toxteth had taken his wounded
heart, or vanity, to Europe; Mrs. Smithers took possession
of Mullen House; and December brooded in
a sulky, rainy mood over the land.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A green Christmas," Mrs. Sanford said, "makes
a full churchyard. I knew we'd have a mild fall when
the 21st of September was so mild. Don't you remember,
mother? The wind was south-west, and the
day very warm."</p>

<p>"The weather has truly been very warm this season,"
replied grandmother Sanford.</p>

<p>"I think it must be the weather," continued Mrs.
Sanford, "that ails Bathalina. She isn't worth any
thing for work now: all she'll do is the heavy talking
and light lifting. She seems to lay up her husband's
death against the doctor. But, as I told her, Peter
wouldn't respond to the medicine; and what could
Charles do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know of only one thing Bathalina is good for
now," Patty remarked. "She'd make a very ornamental
figure in a lunatic-asylum, with her long widow's
veil."</p>

<p>"She is certainly crazy enough," put in Flossy.
"She told me last night that Noah must have been
familiar with the Bible, because he gave his sons names
out of it, and that that showed how old the Bible was."</p>

<p>"There comes Will with the letters," Ease said,
running to meet him.</p>

<p>"It's as good as eating perennial wedding-cake to
see Ease and Will," Flossy laughed. "They are those
two souls, you know, that have only a single thought."</p>

<p>"Young married couples," Patty returned somewhat
cynically, "are apt to be so foolish that a single
thought is quite as much as they can get up between
them."</p>

<p>"You are getting misanthropical," Flossy said. "It
isn't becoming. And, so saying, she went to stir up
the young couple to see&mdash;Oh, here you are!"</p>

<p>"Here's a letter for Patty," Will said: "I think it
is from Hazard Breck."</p>

<p>The letter which he put into his sister's hands was
written in a bold, somewhat boyish hand, which always
seemed to Patty very like Hazard himself. It was as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Patty</span>,&mdash;I don't know as I ought to write to you as
I am going to, but I am sure you are too much my friend not
to understand that I mean right. I want your help; and, to
make things clear, I must tell you something. You know that
Smithers woman who has got possession of Mullen House, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
I dare say you have heard folks blame uncle Tom for taking
so much care of her. He has always treated her better than
she deserved. When her daughter ran away, she came after
him to help find her; but they lost all trace till now. I am mixing
things all up, for I hate to tell you the truth: it must come,
though. You know well enough what father was, and&mdash;think
how hard it is for me to tell you, Patty, and you'll excuse my
writing this&mdash;Mrs. Smithers always said that this girl, her
daughter, was my half-sister. Father asked uncle Tom, on
his death-bed, to take care of the two; and she's had an income
out of his pocket. The man with whom Alice Smithers ran
away from Samoset has left her, and somehow or other she has
got here. She met me on the street, and begged for a bit of
bread. She is sick and penniless, and promises, that, if her
mother will let her come home, she will behave. Mrs. Smithers
only answers her letters by threats of vengeance if she
dares go to Mullen House. I can't write to uncle Tom; for
Mrs. Smithers hates him for having tried to make her behave
decently, and, now that she is independent, she will do nothing
for him. Cannot you do something, Patty, to help this poor
girl? She looks half dead, and she has always been delicate.</p>

<p>I am too troubled about this to write about any thing else;
but I hope you will have a very merry Christmas and a happy
New Year.</p>

<p>
Very truly yours,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Hazard Breck</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Patty read this letter carefully twice. Then she
started up.</p>

<p>"I am going down to the brook for rose-hips to put
about the Christmas-cake," she said.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="ChXLVI." id="ChXLVI.">CHAPTER XLVI.</a></h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Patty</span> went out of the house, and across the
orchard. The grass over which she took her
way was wet with the cold fog that made the air chill.
Everywhere the trees and bushes were loaded with
crystal drops upon which no sun shone to make them
glitter. The fields were faded, and blotched with
patches of gray and brown, and a frost-bitten green.
Patty had thrown over her shoulders a long cloak,
which covered her from head to feet; and as she
walked through the fields she might have passed for
the spirit of the sombre weather.</p>

<p>Along the margin of the brook which separated the
fields of the Putnam place from Dr. Sanford's possessions,
the wild roses grew in profusion, and left so
many of their scarlet hips behind them, that the birds
had not been able to devour the half. Patty moved
along among the leafless shrubs, her cloak catching
upon the briers, and her fingers suffering not unfrequently
from the same sharp cause, while she gathered
the rose-hips for which she had come. The brook,
which was quite free from ice, and somewhat swollen
by rain, gurgled and murmured past her. The drops
shook down upon her from the dripping branches, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
that by the time she reached Black-Clear Eddy her
cloak was pretty thoroughly wet.</p>

<p>She had not been here since the night she threw her
ring into the pool. Remembering how clear was the
water, she leaned over to see if she could discover the
trinket. Looking carefully for some time, she fancied
that her eye caught the gleam of gold. Kneeling
upon the wet margin of the brook, she bent down, and
assured herself that she indeed saw the ring lodged in
a tuft of water-grass. Instantly she longed to recover
it. She began to bare her arm, and then paused,
laughing at her own folly. The pool was something
like eight feet deep, and there seemed no way for her
to get possession of the ring but by the use of a hook
and line. She ruthlessly sacrificed her handkerchief,
tearing it into strips; and, fastening a bent hair-pin to
the end of this improvised line, with a pebble for a
sinker, she began to angle.</p>

<p>"In Black-Clear Eddy apparently," the voice of
Tom Putnam said close behind her.</p>

<p>So absorbed had she been, that she had not heard
him approach. She sprang up quickly, and faced him.</p>

<p>"I wish you a Merry Christmas!" he continued,
before she could speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you!" she answered. "I wish you many.
How came you here?"</p>

<p>"In the simplest way in the world. I walked."</p>

<p>"But people do not usually go strolling about wet
fields in such weather as this."</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean to ask why I came here. I was
going over to pay your grandmother her pension for
the month&mdash;and to see you."</p>

<p>"I am flattered," Patty said, "by even so secondary
a remembrance."</p>

<p>She turned her face towards home, and began slowly
to walk in that direction, as if expecting him to follow.
Every time she encountered her lover, she found it
more difficult to retain her self-possession. So completely
was she now occupied in schooling herself,
that to Putnam she seemed absent and distant.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said, as she turned from him. "You
are leaving your rosebuds."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" she returned, taking them from him.</p>

<p>Their hands touched, and both were conscious of a
thrill.</p>

<p>"What have I done to offend you?" he burst out.
"Why do you avoid me, Patty?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" she asked, fixing her eyes upon the faded
grass.</p>

<p>"You know you do. If I have done any thing
wrong, any thing that offends you, it was at worst a
sin of ignorance, and I sincerely beg your pardon. It
is Christmas time, and you cannot better observe it
than by a general amnesty."</p>

<p>"Will a general amnesty satisfy you, then?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
asked, teasing a tuft of the withered aftermath with
her foot.</p>

<p>Patty understood little her own mood. She desired
intensely to be reconciled to her lover; but she was
tormented by a secret feeling, that, if he loved her as
she wished to be loved, his passion would break down
all obstacles. She could endure a lukewarm affection
better from any man in the world than from him. To
give a sign of her own tenderness, to meet his advances
half way, would leave her unsatisfied, even
though it resulted in that understanding for which she
so ardently longed. She wished to be seized, to be
conquered by a passion so powerful as to break down
all barriers, to sweep away all hinderances. Hazard's
letter, too, had affected her strongly. She had never
really believed her lover guilty of any tangible offence,
but with a woman's inconsistency had secretly required
him to prove his purity. Now that she understood
the nature of his relations with Mrs. Smithers, and
found here one more proof of his unselfishness, she
felt herself contemptible for ever allowing a shadow
of doubt to cross her mind. Her feelings were a wild
mixture, and instinctively she waited to prove the
strength of her lover's passion and its power over her.
She stood there in the misty light, knowing that Putnam
thought her trifling with him, and angry that he
permitted her to do so.</p>

<p>"Is a general amnesty all you desire?" she asked
again, as he remained silent.</p>

<p>"If it is the best you have to give," he said coldly.
"Still I may perhaps be pardoned if I ask why I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
need the grace of an amnesty at all. What is my
offence?"</p>

<p>"Who accused you of any?" she queried evasively.</p>

<p>"Is it a sin of omission, or of commission?" he
persisted.</p>

<p>"Nowadays we seem only to talk in conundrums of
great moral import," she said. "It doesn't seem to
me to amount to much."</p>

<p>Her companion looked at her as might at the sphinx
one whom that monster gave the choice between
guessing her riddle, and being devoured. A sense of
irritation struggled with his love. He felt at once the
annoyance of one who is trifled with, and the strong
tenderness of his regard for this slender woman before
him. He came a step nearer to her.</p>

<p>"Does any thing seem to you to amount to much?"
he demanded. "I think sometimes that you are only
half human. You draw men on to love you, and then
give only mockery in return."</p>

<p>"If there were only a rock in the middle of Black-Clear
Eddy," Patty returned, with an affectation of
the utmost deliberation, "I would certainly get a harp,
and play the Loreley."</p>

<p>She raised her eyes as she spoke, and they met his.
For an instant the two regarded each other as if each
strove for mastery in that long, deep glance. Then
she turned away once more.</p>

<p>"We had better go to the house," she said. "The
grass is very wet."</p>

<p>He took a long stride towards her, and caught her
by the arms, looking full into her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall love me!" he exclaimed in a voice
intense with feeling. "You <i>must</i> love me! I will
have you, Patty, in spite of yourself."</p>

<p>A look of defiance flashed upon him from the dark
eyes, but it faded into one of gladness. She freed
herself gently from his grasp, and moved on. But at
the first step she turned back; and, lifting one of his
hands in both of her own, she kissed it.</p>

<p>"I do love you," she said in a low voice. "I think
I have loved you always."</p>

<p>Then she found herself half smothered in his
arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are few threads which need further gathering
up. Mrs. Smithers persistently refused to receive her
daughter, and the girl soon died from poverty and
heart-break. A late remorse seized the unhappy
mother, who made Mullen House the scene of disgraceful
orgies, until an overdose of opium put an end
to her ill-regulated life. In process of time, by a train
of circumstances which need not be related here,
Mullen House came into the possession of young Dr.
Sanford and his wife: Ease thus returned again to the
home of her ancestors. But all this was long after
the April day upon which Patty and her cousin Flossy
were both united to the men they had chosen. "Giant
Blunderbore and the Princess Thumbling," Will called
Mr. and Mrs. Blood; but the giant was so bewildered
with happiness, that he shook the joker's hand cordially,
and thanked him for his good wishes.</p>

<p>Patty and her husband walked home across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
bridge over the brook, on whose banks the grass was
already green, and the alder-tassels golden.</p>

<p>"Let us look in the eddy," the bride said. "We
might see that ring."</p>

<p>For answer, her husband lifted her hand, and showed
her, embedded in the midst of her wedding-ring, the
golden thread she had thrown in the pool.</p>

<p>"It is symbolical," he said with a happy smile.
"It signifies how my life is enclosed in yours."</p>

<p>She answered him with a look.</p>

Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"Certainly no ordinary novel illustrates a greater variety of types, or illustrates them
better, than this single group of short stories,&mdash;less than half the number in the book,&mdash;and
in no recent novel of New-England life are individuals more graphically portrayed....
Truly a work of rare literary excellence. It offers even to novel-readers a larger return
of interest than most novels do."&mdash;<i>New-York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"There is a charm, a grace, in Mr. Winter's love-verse, which distinguishes it from the
great body of modern love-verse, and which, if it reminds us of any thing, reminds us of
Carew and Lovelace and Sedley at their best. It is fresh, simple, and exceedingly
lovely."&mdash;<i>New-York Mail.</i></p>

in the American imagination. If you cannot go and see for yourself, here is a vicar who
has felt truly picturesque and romantic England, and in a few words, with a very few suggestive
touches, shows you the kind of pleasure that awaits you in English streets and in
the English landscape."&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. W. Curtis</span>, <i>in Harper's Magazine</i>.</p>
